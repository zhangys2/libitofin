A ground-up port of [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib) — the
quantitative-finance library — into idiomatic, memory-safe Rust. The deliverable
is a core library, **`libitofin`**, with thin language bindings on top (Python
first, then a C ABI for everything else).

> The name nods to [Kiyosi Itô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyosi_It%C5%8D),
> whose stochastic calculus underpins modern derivatives pricing.

> ⚠️ **Pre-1.0, under active development.** The core already prices European
> options, Hull-White swaptions (with model calibration), and Heston options
> end-to-end, but the API will change until 1.0 and parts of the pricing surface
> are still being filled in. The **Python bindings** (`itofin`) are published on
> [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/itofin/); a C ABI is planned. See
> [Status](#status).

```sh
cargo add libitofin
```

```rust
use libitofin::time::Date;
// dates, calendars, day counters, curves, vol surfaces, quotes, indexes,
// cashflows, swaps/swaptions, short-rate + Heston models with calibration,
// and analytic option engines are available today - see docs.rs.
```

### Python

The same engine is reachable from Python via [`itofin`](https://pypi.org/project/itofin/)
(Python 3.13+). The API mirrors QuantLib's `ql/` layout: types live in submodules
(`itofin.time`, `itofin.instruments`, `itofin.processes`, ...), while `Settings`
and `ItofinError` stay at the top level. Real market data is first-class - yield
curves (bootstrapped from a deposit/swap strip via `PiecewiseYieldCurve`, or
interpolated), Black-vol surfaces, swaption vol cubes (matrix, interpolated, or
SABR-calibrated), and cap/floor optionlet-vol stripping - so you price against a
market snapshot, not just flat inputs. Type stubs ship in the wheel, so editors
and `mypy` see the full API.

```sh
pip install itofin
```

```python
from itofin import Settings
from itofin.instruments import OptionType, VanillaOption
from itofin.processes import BlackScholesProcess
from itofin.time import Date, DayCounter

s = Settings()
s.set_evaluation_date(Date(15, 6, 2026))
dc = DayCounter.actual360()

process = BlackScholesProcess(60.0, 0.08, 0.0, 0.30, Date(15, 6, 2026), dc)
option = VanillaOption(OptionType.Call, 65.0, Date(15, 6, 2026) + 90, s)
option.set_engine(process)

print(f"NPV   {option.npv():.10f}")   # 2.1333684449
print(f"delta {option.delta():.10f}")  # 0.3724827980
```

…or build a real vol surface (strike x expiry) and query it:

```python
from itofin.termstructures import BlackVarianceSurface
from itofin.time import Date, DayCounter

ref = Date(15, 6, 2026)
vols = BlackVarianceSurface(
    ref,
    [ref + 365, ref + 730],   # expiries
    [90.0, 100.0, 110.0],     # strikes
    [[0.20, 0.25],            # one row per strike,
     [0.18, 0.22],            # one column per expiry
     [0.16, 0.20]],
    DayCounter.actual365_fixed(),
)
print(f"{vols.black_vol(1.0, 100.0):.2f}")  # 0.18
```

…or query a swaption vol surface - here the ATM matrix; `InterpolatedSwaptionVolatilityCube`
and the SABR-calibrated `SabrSwaptionVolatilityCube` add the strike dimension, and
`pricingengines.BlackSwaptionEngine` (via `Swaption.set_black_engine`) prices a
swaption straight off any of them:

```python
from itofin import Settings
from itofin.termstructures import SwaptionVolatilityMatrix, VolatilityType
from itofin.time import Date, Period, Calendar, DayCounter, BusinessDayConvention

s = Settings()
s.set_evaluation_date(Date(15, 6, 2026))
opt = [Period(1, "Years"), Period(5, "Years")]   # option tenors (rows)
swp = [Period(1, "Years"), Period(5, "Years")]   # swap tenors (columns)
vols = [[0.20, 0.18],
        [0.17, 0.16]]

svol = SwaptionVolatilityMatrix(
    Date(15, 6, 2026), Calendar.target(), BusinessDayConvention.Following,
    opt, swp, vols, DayCounter.actual365_fixed(), VolatilityType.ShiftedLognormal,
)
print(f"{svol.volatility(Period(1, 'Years'), Period(5, 'Years'), 0.03):.4f}")  # 0.1800 (node)
print(f"{svol.volatility(Period(3, 'Years'), Period(3, 'Years'), 0.03):.4f}")  # 0.1775 (bilinear)
```

## Why

QuantLib is ~470k lines of mature, battle-tested C++ across 16 modules. This
project re-expresses that core in safe, idiomatic Rust:

- **Memory-safe by construction** — no manual `shared_ptr` cycles or
  use-after-free. The core is single-threaded-mutable during setup, then frozen
  into immutable snapshots; data-race-free parallel compute via `rayon` is the
  planned snapshot-and-fan-out model (not yet wired into the core crate).
- **A clean FFI story** — a single core crate with Python (PyO3) bindings
  shipped today and a growing C-ABI (`cbindgen`) surface, so the same engine is
  reachable from Python, C, C++, Julia, R, and more.
- **Faithful numerics** — QuantLib's `test-suite/` (186 `.cpp` files) is the
  porting oracle: a feature is "done" only when the matching tests are ported and
  the Rust output matches the C++ numbers within tolerance.
- **Usability at the edges** — where C++ leans on runtime casts, silent
  fallbacks, or clock magic, the core prefers compile-time typing and explicit
  errors; ergonomic conveniences live in the binding crates.

## Status

The port proceeds **bottom-up** through dependency layers L0→L11; each layer
depends only on lower-numbered layers. The live backlog is the
[GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/benbenbang/projects/5) and the
repository's issues (the board is the source of truth, not a checked-in file).

| Layer | Epic | Scope | State |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **L0** | core | types, errors, patterns, settings, handle, utilities | ✅ done |
| **L1** | math | array/matrix, distributions, interpolation, integrals, solvers, optimization, statistics, RNG, ODE, copulas, decompositions | ✅ done |
| **L2** | time | `Date`, `Period`, `Calendar`, `DayCounter`, `Schedule`, IMM/ASX/ECB | ✅ done |
| **L3** | quotes | `Quote`, `SimpleQuote`, derived quotes, `InterestRate`, compounding | ✅ done |
| **L4** | term structures | interpolated yield curves, Black-vol curves/surfaces, local vol, swaption vol surfaces (matrix / interpolated / SABR cube), cap-floor term-vol surfaces + optionlet stripping | ✅ done |
| **L5** | processes | multi-factor `StochasticProcess` / `StochasticProcess1D`, Black-Scholes, Heston (analytic surface), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, correlated process array | 🚧 in progress |
| **L6** | indexes | `InterestRateIndex`, Ibor family (Euribor / Eonia / €STR / SOFR), `SwapIndex` | 🚧 in progress |
| **L7** | cashflows | fixed / floating / Ibor / overnight coupons and legs, coupon pricers, duration, capped-floored coupons | 🚧 in progress |
| **L8** | instruments | fixed-rate bonds, vanilla / OIS swaps, swaptions, caps & floors, vanilla options | 🚧 in progress |
| **L9** | methods | lattices, trees (trinomial + Hull-White), Monte Carlo (path generators + antithetic), one-dimensional European vanilla finite differences | 🚧 in progress |
| **L10** | models | `CalibratedModel` + `calibrate()`, short-rate (Vasicek, CIR, Hull-White), Heston, calibration helpers | ✅ core coverage |
| **L11** | engines | analytic European & Heston (Fourier), swaption (Black / Bachelier / Jamshidian), discounting swap / bond, Black cap/floor | ✅ core coverage |

**Milestone 1 (done):** a European option prices end-to-end — quote → flat
yield/vol curves → generalized Black-Scholes process → analytic engine → lazy
instrument greeks — matching QuantLib's `europeanoption.cpp` value and greeks to
double-rounding precision, with the full observer/invalidation graph exercised.

Verified end-to-end since then, each against the matching `test-suite/` oracle:

- **Hull-White calibration** — a Hull-White model calibrates to a swaption strip
  (Jamshidian decomposition + Levenberg-Marquardt), reproducing
  `shortratemodels.cpp`'s cached mean-reversion and volatility.
- **Heston analytic + calibration** — the Fourier `AnalyticHestonEngine` prices
  European options to `hestonmodel.cpp`'s cached values, and a Heston model
  calibrates to a DAX volatility surface (reproducing the reference SSE).

### What's usable today

- **`types` / `errors`** — QuantLib's numeric aliases and `QlError` / `QlResult`
  with `fail!` / `require!` macros (the analogue of `QL_FAIL` / `QL_REQUIRE`).
- **`patterns` / `handle` / `settings`** — the observer/observable graph,
  `LazyObject`, `Handle` / `RelinkableHandle`, and the evaluation-date context.
- **`math`** — arrays and matrices (with SVD/QR/Cholesky/…), the distribution
  family, interpolation (linear → bicubic), integrals (incl. Gauss quadratures),
  1-D solvers, optimizers, statistics, RNGs (MT/Sobol/…), ODEs, copulas.
- **`time`** — dates, periods, 50+ calendars, day counters, schedules, IMM/ASX/ECB.
- **`quotes` / `interestrate`** — simple and derived quotes, interest-rate and
  compounding conversions.
- **`termstructures`** — flat and interpolated yield curves (zero/discount/
  forward), implied and spreaded curves, Black-variance curves/surfaces, local vol,
  swaption vol surfaces (matrix / interpolated / SABR cube) and cap-floor term-vol
  surfaces with optionlet stripping (SABR smile sections + calibrated interpolation).
- **`indexes`** — `InterestRateIndex`, the Ibor family (Euribor / Eonia / €STR /
  SOFR) and `SwapIndex`, with fixings threaded through `Settings` (D11).
- **`cashflows`** — fixed, floating, Ibor and overnight coupons and legs, coupon
  pricers, duration, and capped-floored coupons.
- **`processes`** — the multi-factor `StochasticProcess` base, generalized
  Black-Scholes, Heston (analytic surface), Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and a correlated
  process array.
- **`models`** — `CalibratedModel` with `calibrate()`, the short-rate family
  (Vasicek, CIR, Hull-White), the Heston model, and calibration helpers
  (swaption, Heston).
- **`instruments` / `pricingengines`** — vanilla payoffs and exercise,
  `EuropeanOption`, fixed-rate bonds, vanilla / OIS swaps, swaptions, caps &
  floors; the analytic European and Heston (Fourier) engines, the swaption
  engines (Black / Bachelier / Jamshidian), and discounting swap / bond engines.

## Getting started (development)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for PR size, commit style, and oracle
expectations. Requires the toolchain pinned in
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) (Rust 1.96.0, edition 2024); plain
`cargo` picks it up automatically.

### Rust

```sh
cargo build                          # whole workspace
cargo build -p libitofin             # core crate only

cargo test                           # the porting oracle
cargo test -p libitofin patterns::   # one module

cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

A [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) config runs `fmt`, `check`, `clippy`,
`test`, and conventional-commit linting on every commit:

```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Python bindings (`itofin`)

Requires **Python ≥ 3.13**, then a local editable install via maturin (same flow
as CI):

```sh
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # maturin + pytest (pinned)

maturin develop -m crates/itofin-py/Cargo.toml
pytest crates/itofin-py/tests -v
```

### QuantLib reference tree

The `QuantLib/` entry is a **git-ignored local symlink**, not committed — point
it at a QuantLib checkout to have the reference source and test-suite oracle
available locally:

```sh
ln -s /path/to/QuantLib QuantLib
```

## Project layout

```
crates/libitofin/       the core library — FFI-agnostic, idiomatic Rust
crates/libitofin-ffi/   minimal extern "C" stub (version + errors; full cbindgen API planned)
crates/itofin-py/       PyO3 + maturin → the `itofin` package       (on PyPI)
QuantLib/               reference C++ tree + test oracle           (git-ignored symlink)
```

## Design principles

- **Bottom-up, layer by layer** — never port a module before its dependencies.
- **The C++ test-suite is the oracle** — match the numbers, not just the shape.
- **Small PRs** — ≤350 LOC target, 400 hard cap; large source files split across
  tickets.
- **Single-threaded-mutable core, snapshot-and-fan-out for parallelism** — the
  observable graph is mutated single-threaded during setup, then frozen into
  immutable snapshots. `rayon` parallel compute is the planned model (not yet
  wired into the core). No `async` in the core (QuantLib does no I/O; market
  data is user input).
- **Fidelity in numerics, usability at API boundaries** — QuantLib is the oracle
  for every number, but the core favours compile-time typing and explicit `Result`
  errors over runtime casts and silent fallbacks; convenience lives in the bindings.

## Divergences from QuantLib

The port targets **semantic** faithfulness (matching QuantLib's results), not
bit-for-bit reproduction of its implementation. A small, deliberate set of
divergences is catalogued here. Each is an intentional, reviewed decision (not an
oversight) and is documented at the point of divergence in the source.

**Time / calendars (EPIC-2):**

- **Calendar holiday overrides are per-value, not process-global.** QuantLib
  shares one global `Impl` per market, so `addHoliday` on any `TARGET()` handle
  is visible through every other. This port shares added/removed holidays only
  among *clones* of a `Calendar` value, matching the "explicit state, no hidden
  singletons" decision. The built-in holiday rules are identical; only the
  reach of `add_holiday`/`remove_holiday` differs.
- **`holiday_list` filters weekends by a date-aware rule.** QuantLib's
  `holidayList` excludes weekends using the weekday-only `isWeekend`, which
  misclassifies holidays for markets whose weekend changed over time (Saudi
  Arabia's Thu/Fri→Fri/Sat in 2013, Israel/TASE's Fri/Sat→Sat/Sun in 2026). This
  port filters with a date-aware `is_weekend_on`; fixed-weekend calendars are
  unaffected (the default equals the weekday rule).
- **Table-backed calendars fail loudly past their data horizon.** Where QuantLib
  tabulates lunar / religious / observed holidays only up to a fixed year and
  then silently returns "business day" for later dates, this port panics with a
  clear message once a query passes the last fully-tabulated year. QuantLib's
  tables are kept verbatim; we never fabricate future dates.
- **`Period` comparison is a partial order, and fixes a negative-period bug.**
  QuantLib's `operator<`/`operator==` throw when two periods have overlapping
  day ranges (e.g. `1 Month` vs `30 Days`); this port returns `None` from
  `partial_cmp` instead, so comparison never panics. It also orders the day
  bounds `min <= max` before comparing, which QuantLib omits: for negative
  lengths QuantLib's inverted bounds make overlapping periods (like `-1 Month`
  vs `-30 Days`) look decidably ordered, whereas this port correctly reports
  them as undecidable. Positive comparisons are unaffected.
- **`DayCounter` is always valid; there is no empty placeholder.** QuantLib's
  default-constructed `DayCounter` holds a null `impl_` and `QL_REQUIRE`s a
  non-null one on every call. This port omits the empty state, so a
  `DayCounter` always wraps a concrete convention and its accessors never trip
  that null check. The "not yet set" placeholder used by higher layers is an
  `Option<DayCounter>` at those call sites instead.
- **`Business/252` counts directly instead of via a process-global cache.**
  QuantLib memoizes per-month and per-year business-day totals in global
  `std::map`s keyed by calendar name; this port counts with
  `Calendar::business_days_between` directly. With a calendar's built-in
  schedule the results are identical; once holidays are overridden they can
  differ, since QuantLib's name-keyed cache goes stale while this port always
  reflects the current holiday set.
- **`Actual/Actual (ISMA)` uses the reference-date algorithm.** QuantLib picks a
  schedule-driven implementation when a `Schedule` is supplied and a
  reference-date one otherwise; the reference-date path is ported, with the
  schedule-driven overload following as needed.

**Core (EPIC-0):**

- **An unset evaluation date is an explicit error, not a system-clock fallback.**
  QuantLib's `Settings` singleton falls back to the machine clock; this core has
  no clock (for determinism and FFI), so operations that need the evaluation date
  return `Err` when it is unset rather than silently pricing a possibly-expired
  instrument as live.
- **Past index fixings live on `Settings`, not in a global `IndexManager`
  singleton (D11).** QuantLib stores fixing history in `IndexManager::instance()`,
  a global-singleton `map<string, TimeSeries<Real>>`; D5 forbids that singleton,
  so the history moves onto `Settings` as a `fixing_store`, exactly like the
  evaluation date. It stays shared across every handle to an index (a `Settings`
  is shared, and the store is keyed by the case-insensitive index name), so two
  handles to "the same" Euribor observe one history, as C++'s global map
  guarantees. Each index name owns an `Observable`, so adding or clearing a
  fixing notifies exactly that index's observers, and those notifiers outlive a
  `clear_fixings`. A conflicting fixing on an existing date returns `Err` (D4)
  where QuantLib notifies and then throws. The `enforces_todays_historic_fixings`
  flag's today's-fixing rule is applied by the index layer that reads the store,
  as `InterestRateIndex::fixing` does in C++, not by the store itself.

**Cash flows (EPIC-7):**

- **`Coupon` is not a subtrait of `CashFlow`; one blanket impl derives the
  cash-flow face from the coupon.**
  C++ derives `Coupon` from `CashFlow`, and its base class supplies
  `hasOccurred`, `exCouponDate()` and `isCoupon()` so that no coupon can forget
  them. Rust has no specialization, so under the subtrait shape a `Coupon`
  cannot supply its supertrait's methods on its implementors' behalf. All three
  wrong answers compile and are plausible numbers rather than diagnostics: the
  plain-event `has_occurred` ignores `Settings::includeTodaysCashFlows` on the
  evaluation date; a `None` `ex_coupon_date` accrues ex-coupon while reporting
  `trading_ex_coupon` as `false`; a `None` `as_coupon` contributes nothing to
  `bps`, has its amount subtracted from `atm_rate`'s target, and reports its
  payment date to `maturity_date` in place of its accrual end.

  So `Coupon` restates its own surface (`coupon_base`, `amount`, `rate`,
  `day_counter`, `accrued_amount`, and `AsObservable`), and
  `impl<T: Coupon> CashFlow for T` writes the three exactly once, reading
  `CouponBase`. A coupon cannot get them wrong because it cannot supply them.
  `amount` moves onto `Coupon` for the same reason it must: a blanket that
  *provided* `amount` would give `FixedRateCoupon` a generic body in place of
  its compounded one, and a competing `impl CashFlow for FixedRateCoupon`
  restoring it is a conflicting implementation. The three methods stay required
  on `CashFlow` and `Event` for the flows that are not coupons, which still
  forward explicitly to `event_has_occurred` or `cash_flow_has_occurred`.

  Two costs. `dyn Coupon` does not implement `CashFlow`: the `Some(self)` of
  `as_coupon` is an unsizing coercion, so the blanket takes a `Sized` `T`, and
  `+ ?Sized` would restore the impl and forbid the `Some(self)`. Nothing needs
  it - the `CashFlows` analytics hold a `&dyn CashFlow` already and read only
  `Coupon`'s own methods through the coupon view. And `amount` now sits on both
  traits, so on a concrete coupon with both in scope an unqualified
  `coupon.amount()` is ambiguous; name the trait.

- **The `IborCoupon` par/indexed forecast switch is threaded on `Settings`, not
  a global singleton.** QuantLib's `IborCoupon::indexFixing()` forecast branch
  selects between a par-coupon approximation (rolls `fixingEndDate` off the
  coupon's own accrual end) and an indexed coupon (the index's natural maturity)
  through the `IborCoupon::Settings` singleton (`usingAtParCoupons`, default
  `true`). That process-global switch is what D5 forbids, so the port drops the
  singleton and threads the flag explicitly on `Settings`
  (`using_at_par_coupons`, default `true`) beside the evaluation date and the
  D11 fixing store. The behaviour it governs is fully reproduced: `index_fixing`
  computes the cached `fixingValueDate`/`fixingEndDate`/`spanningTime`
  (`couponpricer.cpp:56-88`) and reads the specialized 3-arg `forecastFixing`
  off the curve; a *determined* fixing is mode-independent and returns the same
  required past fixing as the C++ override. `BlackIborCouponPricer` ports
  `swapletRate = gearing * indexFixing + spread`;
  since a non-in-arrears `Black76` coupon needs no convexity adjustment it needs
  no volatility, and since only `swapletPrice` (not `swapletRate`) reads the
  forwarding-curve discount, the pricer captures no curve. The caplet/floorlet
  optionlet path, the `*Price` methods, and the in-arrears convexity adjustment
  belong to the cap/floor slice; an in-arrears coupon is refused with an `Err`
  rather than priced with a missing convexity term.

- **`IborLeg` builds the plain-vanilla coupons only; caps, floors and the
  in-arrears feature are omitted, not silently dropped.** QuantLib's `IborLeg`
  carries `withCaps`/`withFloors`/`inArrears` builder methods that route the leg
  through `CappedFlooredIborCoupon` and the optionlet pricer. Those belong to the
  cap/floor slice, so this port omits the methods entirely rather than accepting
  the vectors and building plain coupons. The default `BlackIborCouponPricer` is
  attached in `coupons()` (C++ attaches it in `operator Leg()` under the same
  no-cap/no-floor/no-arrears condition, which here always holds); `build()` only
  erases the concrete coupons into a `Leg`, and the free `set_coupon_pricer`
  overrides the default on the concrete coupons, the erased `Leg` carrying no
  downcast. The stub reference dates follow the `FloatingLeg` template
  (`calendar.adjust(end - tenor, bdc)`, no end-of-month flag), which agrees with
  the fixed leg on every multi-coupon schedule. A zero gearing, which the C++
  template collapses to a `FixedRateCoupon`, is not special-cased: `IborCoupon`
  rejects it, so `with_gearing(0.0)` surfaces that `Err` rather than a silent
  fixed coupon.

**Indexes (EPIC-6):**

- **`Currency` is always valid; there is no empty placeholder.** QuantLib's
  default-constructed `Currency` holds a null `data_` and `QL_REQUIRE`s a
  non-null one on every inspector; its `operator==` treats two empty currencies
  as equal and `operator<<` prints `"null currency"`. This port omits the empty
  state, so a `Currency` always holds a concrete specification: accessors never
  trip that null check, equality is purely by name (QuantLib's non-empty
  branch), and `Display` always prints the ISO code. The "not yet set"
  placeholder is an `Option<Currency>` at higher call sites, mirroring the
  `DayCounter` decision above. The `rounding` convention, `triangulationCurrency`
  and `minorUnitCodes` fields are dropped as unused by the index slice; rounding
  returns with the money layer. Only EUR is provided; the `ql/currencies/*`
  catalogue is deferred.

**Pricing engines (Milestone 1):**

- **Zero-volatility Black greeks dispatch on the stored option type, not on the
  sign of `alpha_`.** This is a deliberate divergence where the oracle is
  wrong, and the only place in the port where a *finite* priced number
  intentionally disagrees with QuantLib. Upstream (tree `v1.42.1-266-g9863b578a`,
  from commit `17f1a1bed` "Fixing zero vol for Black") detects the option type
  in its zero-vol branches with `if (alpha_ >= 0) // Call`, at nine sites
  (`blackcalculator.cpp:215,222,229,257,264,271,439,446,453`). For a
  plain-vanilla put, `alpha_ = -1.0 + cum_d1_` (`blackcalculator.cpp:137`), and
  at zero volatility an out-of-the-money put has `cum_d1_ == 1.0` exactly, so
  `alpha_ == 0.0` exactly and `0.0 >= 0` takes the Call branch: the OTM put is
  handed a delta of `+1.0` where the correct value is `0.0`. This port instead
  dispatches on the option type stored in the calculator, implementing the
  values the reference's own comments state, so the OTM-put delta is `0.0`. The
  full zero-vol ladder is pinned by `zero_volatility_ladder_matches_stated_intent`
  and `zero_volatility_otm_put_gets_put_greeks_not_call_greeks` in
  `blackcalculator.rs`, which assert the corrected numbers (OTM `0.0`, ATM
  `-0.5`, ITM `-1.0` for the put, and the call mirror), so a regression to the
  `alpha_ >= 0` form is a test failure.

**Processes (L5):**

- **`HestonProcess::evolve` ports the ctor-default Andersen QE scheme; the
  other seven schemes and `pdf` are deferred.** QuantLib's `HestonProcess`
  overrides `evolve` (`hestonprocess.cpp:396`) with a nine-way `Discretization`
  switch, defaulting to `QuadraticExponentialMartingale`
  (`hestonprocess.hpp:65`). This port implements the shared
  `QuadraticExponential`/`QuadraticExponentialMartingale` body
  (`hestonprocess.cpp:461-516`) and exposes the full `Discretization` enum; the
  remaining seven variants (PartialTruncation, FullTruncation, Reflection,
  NonCentralChiSquareVariance, and the three BroadieKaya exact schemes) return
  `Err` referencing the deferral (#410) rather than silently mispricing via a
  wrong branch. The QE `evolve` drifts the spot by the INTERVAL forward
  `forwardRate(t0, t0+dt, Continuous)`, not the instantaneous forward that
  `drift` uses. The ctor still installs the base Euler
  `expectation`/`std_deviation`/`covariance` (`hestonprocess.cpp:46`), which
  match QuantLib. `pdf`, `varianceDistribution`, and the modified-Bessel /
  complex machinery the BroadieKaya schemes need remain with #410.

**Non-finite inputs (cross-cutting):**

- **Non-finite arguments are rejected at the API boundary.** QuantLib validates
  signs (`stdDev >= 0`, `forward > 0`, `t >= 0`) and relies on NaN failing every
  such comparison, so a NaN is already an error wherever a sign is checked. An
  infinity is not: it passes `>= 0.0` and propagates to a NaN result several
  layers down, and where a curve extrapolates the range check is skipped
  entirely. Following D10, this port widens each of those guards from "not NaN"
  to "finite", and adds finiteness checks where C++ has none at all: solver
  arguments and functor values (`solver1d.rs`), sampled quadrature abscissae
  (`discrete.rs`), Black-Scholes process arguments (`blackscholesprocess.rs`),
  and the volatility and variance an implementation returns
  (`termstructures/volatility/`). Each site names the C++ guard it extends, or
  states that none exists. The only behavioural change is for infinities; every
  finite input QuantLib accepts is still accepted, so no priced number moves.
- **Statistics accumulators reject a NaN sample value, and accept infinities.**
  QuantLib's only sample guard is `QL_REQUIRE(weight >= 0.0)`
  (`generalstatistics.hpp:233`, `incrementalstatistics.cpp:127`), which this
  port keeps verbatim, written `!(weight >= 0.0)` so a NaN weight fails it as it
  does in C++. A NaN *value* has no C++ guard: it is accumulated and poisons
  every subsequent mean, variance and percentile with no diagnostic. Infinite
  values remain accepted, as in C++, being meaningful to `min`, `max` and the
  risk measures.
- **Shape mismatches panic with a named cause.** `SVD::solveFor`
  (`svd.cpp:528`) and the default `CostFunction::gradient` / `jacobian` have no
  `QL_REQUIRE`; a wrongly-sized output leaves stale entries the optimiser reads
  as real derivatives. These are caller errors, not market-data errors, so the
  port asserts rather than returning `Err`.
