//! Bootstrap-helper base for curve construction.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/bootstraphelper.hpp`. A bootstrap helper prices
//! one market instrument against the curve being built and reports the error
//! between the market quote and the curve-implied quote; the bootstrap solves
//! each curve node until that error is zero.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - C++ `BootstrapHelper<TS>` is a template over the term-structure type, with
//!   `BootstrapHelper<YieldTermStructure>` typedef'd `RateHelper`
//!   (`ratehelpers.hpp:47`) and `BootstrapHelper<DefaultProbabilityTermStructure>`
//!   typedef'd `DefaultProbabilityHelper`
//!   (`credit/defaultprobabilityhelpers.hpp:41`). This port splits the template
//!   in two along the line Rust's trait objects draw. The *state* -
//!   [`BootstrapHelperBase`] - keeps the `TS` parameter, defaulted to
//!   [`YieldTermStructure`] so the yield helpers name it bare. The *interface*
//!   is one trait per family ([`RateHelper`] here,
//!   [`DefaultProbabilityHelper`](crate::termstructures::credit::defaultprobabilityhelpers::DefaultProbabilityHelper)
//!   for credit), because a single trait generic over `TS` could not be made
//!   into the `dyn RateHelper` object the whole yield layer is typed on.
//!   [`BootstrapHelperShared`] then names the slice of that interface the
//!   bootstrap driver actually uses, so one driver serves both families.
//! - The `AcyclicVisitor` `accept` hook is omitted; no visitor is ported.
//!
//! ## The ownership and observation contract
//!
//! A helper is handed the curve that is bootstrapping it through
//! [`set_term_structure`](RateHelper::set_term_structure), and holds it as a
//! [`Weak`] back-pointer. This is deliberate and load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Non-owning.** The curve owns its helpers; a strong [`Shared`] here
//!    would close a reference cycle and leak. C++ stores a raw `TS*` and links
//!    the concrete helper's pricing handle with a `null_deleter` shared_ptr
//!    (`ratehelpers.cpp:217`) precisely to say "borrowed, not owned"; [`Weak`]
//!    is the faithful analogue.
//! 2. **Not observed.** The helper does **not** register as an observer of the
//!    curve (C++'s `observer = false`). During a bootstrap the solver moves the
//!    curve while reading the helper; observing it back would loop forever.
//!    That is why a concrete [`implied_quote`](RateHelper::implied_quote) forces
//!    its own recalculation rather than relying on a notification. Storing a
//!    plain [`Weak`] with no `register_observer` call structurally enforces this.
//!
//! The helper *does* observe its own quote (the market rate being fitted): a
//! quote change notifies the helper's observers, which is how a re-quote
//! triggers a re-bootstrap.
