//! Interest-rate term structure.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/yieldtermstructure.{hpp,cpp}`: the
//! [`YieldTermStructure`] trait extends [`TermStructure`] with the
//! discount-factor, zero-yield and forward-rate algebra, all derived from the
//! single required [`discount_impl`](YieldTermStructure::discount_impl).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - Jump quotes (the turn-of-year effect: `jumps`/`jumpDates` constructor
//!   arguments, the jump inspectors and the jump-aware `discount`) are not
//!   ported; no flat curve uses them and they follow with the bootstrapped
//!   curves as a follow-up. Without jumps the C++ `update()` override is a
//!   no-op, so the base updater behaviour
//!   ([`TermStructureBase::updater`](super::TermStructureBase::updater)) is
//!   already complete.
//! - C++ overloads on `Date`/`Time`/`Period` become distinct method names
//!   (`discount_date`, `forward_rate_between`, ...), following the
//!   [`InterestRate`] port convention.
