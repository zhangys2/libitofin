//! Bootstrap traits and the mutable node plumbing they drive.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/yield/bootstraptraits.hpp` (the `Discount`
//! traits) together with the curve-side node storage the bootstrap mutates.
//!
//! ## The mutation decision
//!
//! In C++ `IterativeBootstrap` is a *friend* of `PiecewiseYieldCurve` and
//! writes straight into `ts_->data_`, `ts_->interpolation_` and `ts_->dates_`
//! (`iterativebootstrap.hpp:296-316`). Rust has no friendship and no
//! inheritance, so the decision this port makes is: the node data lives in a
//! [`CurveData`] holder the curve keeps behind a `RefCell`, and the bootstrap
//! mutates it through this type's methods. The bootstrap borrows the cell
//! mutably to write one node and rebuild the interpolation over the solved
//! prefix, then *drops that borrow* before asking a helper to reprice - the
//! helper reads the same curve back (through its weak handle), so the two
//! borrows must never overlap. That discipline is what makes a `RefCell`
//! sufficient here instead of a second ownership scheme.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! All four upstream yield conventions are ported: `Discount`, `ZeroYield`,
//! `ForwardRate` and `SimpleZeroYield` (`bootstraptraits.hpp:312`), the last
//! adding the `-1/t` rate floor its simply compounded nodes need.
//!
//! ## The trait split
//!
//! C++ has one trait struct per convention. This port splits the Rust trait in
//! two along the line the bootstrap driver draws: [`BootstrapTraits`] carries
//! the six statics the driver calls to solve a node, and
//! [`YieldBootstrapTraits`] adds `discount_from_nodes`, which only a yield
//! curve's `discount_impl` calls. That lets the one driver serve a second
//! term-structure family whose nodes are not discount factors.
