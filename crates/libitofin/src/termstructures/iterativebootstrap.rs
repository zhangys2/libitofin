//! Iterative piecewise-curve bootstrap.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/iterativebootstrap.hpp`. Given a set of rate
//! helpers, the bootstrap solves the curve node at each pillar so that the
//! helper repricing off the curve reproduces its market quote
//! (`helper.quote_error() == 0`).
//!
//! ## What is ported, and what is deferred
//!
//! The driver mirrors `IterativeBootstrap::calculate`: a forward pass solves
//! the curve node at each pillar in maturity order, and an outer convergence
//! loop (`iterativebootstrap.hpp:257,363-387`) repeats that pass when the
//! interpolator is *global* (`Interpolator::GLOBAL`, true for `Cubic`) or when
//! a pillar date precedes its helper's latest-relevant date (`:205-207`).
//! Under a global interpolator every node depends on all others, so one pass
//! leaves the curve mispriced; the loop re-solves every node - each against
//! the full-range interpolation seeded by the previous pass - until the
//! largest node change of a pass is within the bootstrap accuracy. Exhausting
//! `Traits::max_iterations` passes without converging is an explicit `Err`
//! (the C++ `dontThrow=false` branch, `:376-383`). For the local
//! interpolators (`Linear`, `LogLinear`, `BackwardFlat`), whose wired helpers
//! pin the pillar at the latest-relevant date, neither condition fires and the
//! bootstrap stays a single forward pass.
//!
//! Two branches of the C++ algorithm are deliberately not ported:
//!
//! - **The `Linear` interpolation fallback** (`:296-308`), which substitutes
//!   `Linear` while a global interpolation cannot yet span the solved prefix.
//!   It is unreachable for the wired `Cubic` (`required_points()` is 2, so
//!   every prefix of length >= 2 builds) and type-incompatible with the
//!   monomorphized holder: `CurveData<I>` stores `Option<I::Output>`, which
//!   cannot hold a `LinearInterpolation` where a `CubicInterpolation` is
//!   expected - C++ only manages the swap through its type-erased
//!   `Interpolation`. Only an interpolator needing >= 4 points (Akima,
//!   Lagrange), none of which is wired, could ever reach it.
//! - **The robustness fallbacks** - `dontThrow`, `maxAttempts` bound-widening
//!   retries and the `validCurve_` invalidate-and-retry recursion
//!   (`:318-358`) - deferred to #941. Every solve failure and non-convergence
//!   here is an explicit `Err` (D4), never a silent partial curve.
//!
//! Both solvers the C++ uses are wired: `Brent` runs the first (fresh) pass and
//! `FiniteDifferenceNewtonSafe` runs a re-bootstrap seeded from a still-valid
//! previous curve (`:318-322`), the path a quote change takes.
//!
//! ## Duplicate pillars are rejected, not pruned (matching QuantLib)
//!
//! `IterativeBootstrap` hard-throws on two ordering violations: a duplicate
//! pillar date (`iterativebootstrap.hpp:190-191`) and a `latestRelevantDate`
//! that does not strictly advance (`:194-201`). This port reproduces both as the
//! two `require!` checks below (a duplicate pillar, then a non-monotone
//! latest-relevant date). That is faithful, not a defect: `IterativeBootstrap`
//! has **no** redundant-helper pruning upstream. The only dedup in QuantLib
//! lives in the separate `GlobalBootstrap` (`globalbootstrap.hpp:288`),
//! and even there it dedups a date grid for a least-squares solve rather than
//! dropping a helper. So there is nothing to port. This corrects the original
//! #532 premise that the bootstrap "should prune redundant helpers"; the correct
//! behaviour for a genuine duplicate is the error, and callers must supply a
//! strip with distinct pillars. `GlobalBootstrap` itself (a global
//! least-squares fit) is a separate algorithm, ported alongside this one.
