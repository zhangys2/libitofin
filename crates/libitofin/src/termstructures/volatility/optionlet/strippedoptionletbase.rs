//! Stripped-optionlet interface (`StrippedOptionletBase`).
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/volatility/optionlet/strippedoptionletbase.hpp`:
//! the abstract interface for a time-indexed vector of strike-indexed optionlet
//! (caplet/floorlet) volatilities. A concrete stripper (the
//! [`OptionletStripper`](super::OptionletStripper) base plus the stripping
//! algorithm in #575) implements it; the interpolated
//! optionlet surface (#576) reads through it.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - C++ `StrippedOptionletBase` derives `LazyObject`; the vector accessors call
//!   `calculate()` and can therefore fail, so each returns a [`QlResult`] and an
//!   owned vector rather than the C++ `const&`. The laziness itself lives on the
//!   concrete stripper (#575), not on this interface.
//! - Concrete strippers expose their notification graph through the optional
//!   observable accessor; custom legacy implementations can retain the default.
