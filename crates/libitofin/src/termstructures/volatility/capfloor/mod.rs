//! Cap/floor term-volatility structures.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/volatility/capfloor/`.
//! [`CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure`] adds the cap/floor term-volatility query
//! on top of [`VolatilityTermStructure`], mirroring how
//! [`SwaptionVolatilityStructure`](super::SwaptionVolatilityStructure) layers the
//! swaption volatility on the same base. Unlike the swaption surface, which is
//! indexed by option date and swap length, this structure is indexed by
//! cap/floor length (option time) and strike alone; the length- and strike-range
//! checks run exactly as the C++ base performs them before dispatching to the
//! volatility hook.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - QuantLib overloads `volatility` across three argument shapes (option tenor,
//!   end date, end time). Rust has no overloading, so the three forms are ported
//!   as [`volatility_tenor`](CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure::volatility_tenor),
//!   [`volatility_date`](CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure::volatility_date) and
//!   [`volatility_time`](CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure::volatility_time). The
//!   required hook is [`volatility_impl`](CapFloorTermVolatilityStructure::volatility_impl)
//!   alone, mirroring C++'s pure-virtual `volatilityImpl(Time, Rate)`.
