//! Year-on-year inflation optionlet volatility.
//!
//! Port of the part of
//! `ql/termstructures/volatility/inflation/yoyinflationoptionletvolatilitystructure.{hpp,cpp}`
//! a year-on-year cap/floor coupon reads: [`YoYOptionletVolatilitySurface`] is
//! the surface a `YoYInflationOptionletCouponPricer` prices against, and
//! [`ConstantYoYOptionletVolatility`] is the flat one.
//!
//! Inflation volatility is quoted against *dates*. The observation lag and the
//! publication period make a date the only unambiguous key, so C++ gives its
//! lagged queries - `volatility(Date)`, `volatility(Period)` and
//! `totalVariance` - no time-based form at all, and says so (`hpp:63`, `:91`).
//! It does carry one raw `volatility(Time, Rate)` (`hpp:75`) that applies no lag
//! or period adjustment; nothing reads it, so the port omits it too.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! The trait carries the three members the pricer calls
//! (`inflationcouponpricer.cpp:99`, `:114-117`), plus the defaulted
//! [`base_level`](YoYOptionletVolatilitySurface::base_level) whose default *is*
//! C++'s unset state, and nothing else. C++ reaches
//! them through `VolatilityTermStructure`, whose `timeFromBase`, `baseLevel`,
//! `checkRange` and tenor-keyed overloads serve the stripping hierarchy rather
//! than the coupon; [`ConstantYoYOptionletVolatility`] implements
//! [`TermStructure`](crate::termstructures::TermStructure) and
//! [`VolatilityTermStructure`](super::VolatilityTermStructure) itself, so a
//! caller holding the concrete surface keeps the whole face and a caller
//! holding `dyn YoYOptionletVolatilitySurface` carries only what it prices with.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! Every query takes its observation lag explicitly. C++ defaults the argument
//! to the sentinel `Period(-1, Days)` and substitutes the surface's own
//! `observationLag()` for it (`.cpp:98-102`, `:136-139`); the port has no
//! sentinel because it has no default argument to carry one - the pricer passes
//! `Period(0, Days)` verbatim, as C++ does (`inflationcouponpricer.cpp:114-117`),
//! and a caller wanting the surface's lag passes
//! [`observation_lag`](ConstantYoYOptionletVolatility::observation_lag).
//!
//! [`base_date`](YoYOptionletVolatilitySurface::base_date) returns a
//! [`QlResult`] where C++ returns a bare `Date`: it reads the reference date,
//! which under D10 refuses rather than inventing one when no evaluation date is
//! set, and the period snapping refuses a frequency finer than monthly.
//!
//! ## The stripped hierarchy (#874)
//!
//! The stripped and interpolated hierarchy of `ql/experimental/inflation/`
//! lands here beside the flat surface: the shared
//! [`YoYOptionletVolatilitySurfaceBase`] holder - with `baseLevel`, which
//! exists to seed the stripping bootstraps, as the trait's defaulted
//! [`base_level`](YoYOptionletVolatilitySurface::base_level) -
//! [`InterpolatedYoYOptionletVolatilityCurve`],
//! [`PiecewiseYoYOptionletVolatilityCurve`] and its [`YoYOptionletHelper`]s,
//! the [`YoYOptionletStripper`]s and
//! [`KInterpolatedYoYOptionletVolatilitySurface`], whose `Dslice` oracle
//! (`test-suite/inflationvolatility.cpp:271-352`) closes the stack.
