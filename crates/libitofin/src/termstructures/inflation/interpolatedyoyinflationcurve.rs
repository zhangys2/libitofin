//! Inflation term structure based on the interpolation of year-on-year rates.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/inflation/interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp`
//! (header-only): [`InterpolatedYoYInflationCurve`] builds a
//! [`YoYInflationTermStructure`] from (date, year-on-year rate) nodes
//! interpolated in rate space, composing the shared
//! [`InflationTermStructureBase`] holder with an [`InterpolatedCurve`];
//! [`YoYInflationCurve`] is the C++ `typedef` for the linearly interpolated
//! case (`interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp:87`).
//!
//! The quoted rates are *not* year-on-year inflation-swap quotes
//! (`interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp:37`); a curve fitted to those is
//! [`PiecewiseYoYInflationCurve`](super::piecewiseyoyinflationcurve::PiecewiseYoYInflationCurve).
//!
//! It mirrors
//! [`InterpolatedZeroInflationCurve`](super::interpolatedzeroinflationcurve::InterpolatedZeroInflationCurve)
//! throughout, including the node times being measured from the *reference
//! date* rather than from the first node, which leaves the first time negative.
//! The one divergence between the two is the base rate: C++ forwards
//! `rates[0]` into the base constructor's `baseRate` slot
//! (`interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp:99-100`) where the zero curve passes
//! nothing, so [`base_rate`](InflationTermStructure::base_rate) succeeds here
//! and errors there.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - The protected constructor for descendants that cannot supply their nodes
//!   at construction (`interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp:79-85,124-133`) is
//!   omitted rather than deferred: it exists in C++ only because
//!   `PiecewiseYoYInflationCurve` *derives* from this class, and this port's
//!   piecewise curve is standalone (as its zero sibling is), so nothing could
//!   call it.
//! - The seasonality constructor argument (`:50`) is ported, but the
//!   consistency gate C++ runs from the base constructor runs here from this
//!   one, once the curve exists; see the
//!   [`inflationtermstructure`](super::inflationtermstructure) divergences.
//! - C++ reads `dates.at(0)` in the initializer list *before* checking the
//!   size, throwing `out_of_range` on an empty vector; here the size check
//!   runs first and every input problem is a `QlError` per D4.
