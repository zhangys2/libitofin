//! Piecewise-bootstrapped year-on-year inflation term structure.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/inflation/piecewiseyoyinflationcurve.hpp:37-154`.
//! A [`PiecewiseYoYInflationCurve`] is built from [`YoYInflationHelper`]s - in
//! practice year-on-year inflation swaps - whose observed fixing periods mark
//! the segment boundaries; each node is solved so the helper reprices its
//! quoted rate off the curve, by the same [`IterativeBootstrap`] the zero,
//! yield and credit sides run.
//!
//! It mirrors
//! [`PiecewiseZeroInflationCurve`](super::piecewisezeroinflationcurve::PiecewiseZeroInflationCurve)
//! field for field. C++ derives from `InterpolatedYoYInflationCurve<Interpolator>`
//! *and* `LazyObject` (`:40-42`); Rust has no inheritance, so the node storage
//! lives here and [`yoy_rate_impl`](YoYInflationTermStructure::yoy_rate_impl)
//! reads it the way [`InterpolatedYoYInflationCurve`] reads its own
//! (`interpolatedyoyinflationcurve.hpp:147-150`).
//!
//! [`InterpolatedYoYInflationCurve`]: super::interpolatedyoyinflationcurve::InterpolatedYoYInflationCurve
//!
//! ## Node zero carries the base rate, and keeps it
//!
//! This is the difference from the zero curve that the whole
//! [`YoYInflationTraits`] transcription exists for, and it takes two halves
//! that only work together. C++'s `YoYInflationTraits::initialValue` reads the
//! curve's *own* base rate off the term-structure pointer it is handed
//! (`inflationtraits.hpp:129-131`) where the zero convention returns a dummy
//! constant (`:50-53`), so this curve overrides
//! [`PiecewiseCurve::initial_value`] with
//! [`base_rate`](InflationTermStructure::base_rate) - the hook existing for
//! exactly this case. And C++'s `YoYInflationTraits::updateGuess` writes only
//! node `i` (`:175-179`) where the zero convention also mirrors the first
//! solved pillar onto node 0 (`:100-102`), so the seeded base rate is never
//! overwritten. Seed the node from the traits constant instead, or mirror
//! pillar 1 onto it, and the curve publishes an invented figure at its base
//! date in place of a quoted one.
//!
//! The base *date* anchoring node zero is the zero curve's behaviour unchanged:
//! `initialDate` is the curve's `baseDate()` on both conventions (`:124-126`
//! against `:46-48`), so the first node precedes the reference date and its
//! time is negative.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - The seasonality argument (`:61`) is ported, and so is C++'s virtual
//!   `update()` behind
//!   [`set_seasonality`](InflationTermStructure::set_seasonality): installing
//!   one invalidates the bootstrap, so the next read re-solves every node
//!   against the corrected rates. The consistency gate runs from this
//!   constructor rather than from the base one; see the
//!   [`inflationtermstructure`](super::inflationtermstructure) divergences.
//! - The `accuracy` constructor argument (`:62`) is not exposed, matching the
//!   zero curve; the field carries the C++ default, which is `1.0e-12` here
//!   against the zero curve's `1.0e-14`.
//! - Only [`Linear`] is constructible ([`new`](PiecewiseYoYInflationCurve::new)
//!   builds the interpolator itself), so the C++ `Interpolator` argument
//!   (`:63`) has no counterpart. The impls below are generic, so a second
//!   constructor is all another local interpolator needs.
