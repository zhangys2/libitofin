//! Seasonality corrections applied to inflation term structures.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/inflation/seasonality.{hpp,cpp}`:
//! [`Seasonality`] is the transformation an inflation curve folds into the
//! rates it publishes. [`MultiplicativePriceSeasonality`] multiplies price index
//! levels, while [`KerkhofSeasonality`] accumulates monthly factors for zero rates.
//!
//! Seasonality fills in an inflation curve between the integer-year maturities
//! the market quotes. Stationary (one year of factors) multiplicative price
//! seasonality moves zero-coupon rates but leaves year-on-year rates alone;
//! multi-year factor sets move both. The correction is piecewise constant, so
//! it works with un-interpolated inflation indexes
//! (`seasonality.hpp:34-53,81-118`).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - [`KerkhofSeasonality`] validates its twelve-month contract at construction
//!   and replacement, instead of deferring that check until factor lookup.
//!   It does not expose the inherited arbitrary-frequency C++ setter.
//! - C++'s `set` assigns the fields and *then* validates, leaving an invalid
//!   object behind on failure; [`MultiplicativePriceSeasonality::set`] builds
//!   the replacement first, so a rejected input leaves the receiver untouched.
//! - `iTS.dayCounter()` may be an empty day counter in C++; here it is
//!   [`TermStructure::require_day_counter`], which errors on a curve carrying
//!   none (D10).
//! - The factor lookup, the validation and the corrections all return
//!   [`QlResult`] where C++ throws, `inflation_period` being fallible.
