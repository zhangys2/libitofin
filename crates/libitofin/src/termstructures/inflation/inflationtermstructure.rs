//! Inflation term structures.
//!
//! Port of `ql/termstructures/inflationtermstructure.{hpp,cpp}`:
//! [`InflationTermStructureBase`] is the shared holder concrete inflation
//! curves embed (C++'s data members), [`InflationTermStructure`] is the
//! inflation contract over [`TermStructure`], and
//! [`ZeroInflationTermStructure`] adds the zero-coupon inflation rate derived
//! from the single required
//! [`zero_rate_impl`](ZeroInflationTermStructure::zero_rate_impl).
//! [`YoYInflationTermStructure`] is its year-on-year sibling, derived the same
//! way from [`yoy_rate_impl`](YoYInflationTermStructure::yoy_rate_impl).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - `observationLag_` / `observationLag()` are not ported: they are
//!   deprecated at the curve level since QuantLib 1.39
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.hpp:68-73,82-89,107-112`), the lag being an
//!   observation property of the helpers and instruments rather than of the
//!   curve. `hasExplicitBaseDate()` (`inflationtermstructure.hpp:83-89`),
//!   deprecated alongside them and a constant `true`, is dropped with them.
//! - The deprecated four-argument `zeroRate(d, instObsLag,
//!   forceLinearInterpolation, extrapolate)`
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.hpp:150-155`) is not ported, and with it the
//!   `forceLinearInterpolation` branch that interpolates between the two
//!   period ends (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:147-159`). The ported
//!   [`zero_rate_date`](ZeroInflationTermStructure::zero_rate_date) is the
//!   live two-argument overload, which delegates with a zero lag and no
//!   forced interpolation (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:134-138`), so it takes
//!   the `else` branch only.
//! - The deprecated four-argument `yoyRate(d, instObsLag,
//!   forceLinearInterpolation, extrapolate)`
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.hpp:216-222`) is dropped for the same reasons,
//!   and with it its own `forceLinearInterpolation` branch
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:226-238`). The ported
//!   [`yoy_rate_date`](YoYInflationTermStructure::yoy_rate_date) is the live
//!   two-argument overload, delegating with a zero lag
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:210-214`).
//! - C++ gates [`Seasonality::is_consistent`] inside the three
//!   `InflationTermStructure` constructors, against a partially constructed
//!   `*this` (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:34-38,57-61,79-83`). A Rust holder
//!   is not the curve and cannot produce the `&dyn InflationTermStructure`
//!   that check needs, so the gate moves *out* to the concrete curve
//!   constructors, which run
//!   [`check_seasonality`](InflationTermStructure::check_seasonality) once
//!   they have a whole curve. The holder still stores whatever it is given.
//! - C++'s `setSeasonality` closes with a call to the virtual `update()`
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.cpp:87`); the Rust equivalent is
//!   [`update_after_seasonality_change`](InflationTermStructure::update_after_seasonality_change),
//!   a separate overridable hook, because the notification a bootstrapped
//!   curve owes its observers also has to invalidate its own cache.
//! - The seasonality is held in a [`RefCell`] rather than as a plain field:
//!   C++ `setSeasonality` is non-const and called on the concrete curve, which
//!   here lives behind a [`Shared`] that hands out only shared references.
//! - C++'s `checkRange` overloads *hide* `TermStructure::checkRange`; Rust
//!   traits have no name hiding, so they are ported under distinct names
//!   ([`check_inflation_range_date`](InflationTermStructure::check_inflation_range_date)
//!   and
//!   [`check_inflation_range_time`](InflationTermStructure::check_inflation_range_time)).
//!   An inflation curve must call those, never the
//!   [`TermStructure`] ones, whose lower bounds are strictly tighter.
//! - C++ overloads on `Date`/`Time` become distinct method names, the `_date`
//!   suffix taking dates.
