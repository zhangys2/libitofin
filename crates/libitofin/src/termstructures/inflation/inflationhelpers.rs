//! Bootstrap helpers for inflation term structures.
//!
//! Port of the helper base `ZeroCouponInflationSwapHelper` derives from
//! (`ql/termstructures/inflation/inflationhelpers.hpp:36-37`, a
//! `RelativeDateBootstrapHelper<ZeroInflationTermStructure>`) together with the
//! plain `BootstrapHelper<ZeroInflationTermStructure>` the traits name as their
//! helper type (`inflationtraits.hpp:43`) and its year-on-year twin
//! (`:121`). They are the inflation twins of
//! [`RateHelper`](crate::termstructures::bootstraphelper::RateHelper) and
//! [`DefaultProbabilityHelper`](crate::termstructures::credit::defaultprobabilityhelpers::DefaultProbabilityHelper),
//! and they carry no behaviour of their own: everything is inherited from the
//! shared [`BootstrapHelperBase`], instantiated here over
//! [`ZeroInflationTermStructure`].
//!
//! Where C++ gets every family from one class template, this port needs one
//! trait per family, because a trait generic over its term structure cannot be
//! made into the bare trait object the curves are typed on. The shared driver
//! reaches all three through [`BootstrapHelperShared`], implemented below on
//! `dyn ZeroInflationHelper`.
//!
//! [`ZeroCouponInflationSwapHelper`] (`inflationhelpers.hpp:35`) and
//! [`YearOnYearInflationSwapHelper`] (`:118`) are the concrete helpers, one per
//! family, and each plugs into its own base.
//!
//! ## Deferred within EPIC Inflation (#705)
//!
//! - The zero-coupon helper's **start/end-date constructor** (`cpp:52-69`)
//!   landed with #806 as [`with_start_date`](ZeroCouponInflationSwapHelper::with_start_date);
//!   the year-on-year helper stays relative-date only, and the deprecated
//!   nominal-curve constructor (`cpp:71-86`) stays out.
//! - The `Pillar::CustomDate` choice, on both helpers (`cpp:140-150` and
//!   `cpp:271-281`, #808), which needs an explicit pillar date threaded through
//!   construction plus its bounds check.
