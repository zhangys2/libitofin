//! Relinkable shared handle to an observable.
//!
//! Port of `ql/handle.hpp` (design decision D2). All copies of a [`Handle`]
//! share one inner `Link`; relinking through a [`RelinkableHandle`] swaps the
//! pointee for every copy and notifies the link's observers.
//!
//! QuantLib's `Link` is an *observer of its pointee* as well as an observable:
//! changes inside the pointee propagate to observers of the handle, and
//! relinking moves that registration to the new pointee. The port mirrors the
//! `handle.hpp` precondition "class T must inherit from Observable" with the
//! [`AsObservable`] bound on handle pointees and forwards every pointee
//! notification to the link's own observers - unless the handle was built
//! through [`Handle::new_unregistered`], the port of the C++
//! `registerAsObserver = false` constructor flag.
