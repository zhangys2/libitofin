//! Statistics accumulators ported from `ql/math/statistics/`.
//!
//! QuantLib layers its statistics tools through class templates
//! (`GenericGaussianStatistics<S>`, `GenericRiskStatistics<S>`); we express
//! the same genericity over the sample accumulator with traits:
//! [`MeanStdDev`] is the minimal interface (what a precomputed-distribution
//! holder provides), [`Statistics`] the full accumulator interface, and
//! [`EmpiricalStatistics`] the extra interface of accumulators that keep the
//! whole sample set, such as [`GeneralStatistics`].
