//! The overnight leg builder.
//!
//! Port of the `OvernightLeg` half of `ql/cashflows/overnightindexedcoupon.{hpp,cpp}`
//! (the builder shares the coupon's header at `overnightindexedcoupon.hpp:215`, not
//! a `cashflowvectors`-style file). A fluent builder turning a [`Schedule`] plus
//! notionals, gearings and spreads into a sequence of
//! [`OvernightIndexedCoupon`]s over an [`OvernightIndex`], the overnight analogue
//! of [`IborLeg`](super::IborLeg). The first and last periods may be a short or
//! long stub, in which case the coupon accrues against a reference period one
//! tenor away from the stub so a schedule-aware day counter still sees a regular
//! period.
//!
//! This port reproduces the `operator Leg()` loop of `overnightindexedcoupon.cpp:564`
//! rather than [`IborLeg`](super::IborLeg)'s `FloatingLeg` template: the two build
//! loops differ, and the stub reference dates here are adjusted with the builder's
//! own payment convention (`paymentAdjustment_`), not the schedule's convention.
//!
//! ## The pricer: no `withCouponPricer`
//!
//! Unlike [`IborLeg`](super::IborLeg), C++ `OvernightLeg` carries a pricer builder,
//! `withCouponPricer(const ext::shared_ptr<OvernightIndexedCouponPricer>&)`
//! (`overnightindexedcoupon.hpp:245`), applied at `operator Leg()`
//! (`overnightindexedcoupon.cpp:668`) only when one was supplied. This port omits
//! that builder method, for reasons rooted in the ported surface:
//!
//! - Its only caller in the test suite is the caps/floors path
//!   (`overnightindexedcoupon.cpp:246-252` of the test fixture), which builds a
//!   `CappedFlooredOvernightIndexedCoupon` through a `Black...` pricer. Both the
//!   capped coupon and those pricers are deferred (see below), so no ported call
//!   ever supplies a pricer.
//! - [`OvernightIndexedCoupon`] installs its own
//!   averaging pricer in its constructor and holds a
//!   reference to it in a private field that its rate-bearing inspectors
//!   (`accrued_amount`, `effective_spread`) read directly. Overriding that pricer
//!   after construction would desync that field from the embedded
//!   [`FloatingRateCoupon`](super::floatingratecoupon::FloatingRateCoupon)'s
//!   pricer, so the coupon exposes no override hook and none can be added without
//!   touching the coupon (a separate ticket's file).
//!
//! When the caps/floors coupon and its Black pricers are ported, `withCouponPricer`
//! lands with them, applied only when supplied so the constructor default stands
//! otherwise.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! C++ ends the builder with `operator Leg()`. The port splits that into
//! [`OvernightLeg::coupons`], which keeps the concrete [`OvernightIndexedCoupon`]
//! type, and [`OvernightLeg::build`], which erases it into a [`Leg`]. Each coupon
//! carries the averaging pricer its own constructor installed; the leg attaches
//! none.
//!
//! ## Deferred (later sub-tickets of #69)
//!
//! Caps and floors (`withCaps`/`withFloors`/`withNakedOption`/`withDailyCapFloor`,
//! which build a `CappedFlooredOvernightIndexedCoupon`), and with them the
//! in-advance default (`inArrears_` defaults to `true` in C++, and the reference
//! computation dates it drives), the lookback, lockout and observation-shift
//! knobs, telescopic value dates, rounding precision, the last-recent-period knob
//! and explicit payment dates. Their builder methods are omitted entirely rather
//! than accepted and ignored, since [`OvernightIndexedCoupon`] does not accept the
//! corresponding constructor arguments. A zero gearing, which C++ collapses to a
//! `FixedRateCoupon`, is likewise not special-cased: the port's coupon rejects it,
//! so `with_gearing(0.0)` surfaces that error rather than a silent fixed coupon.

    //!
    //! Two of them read surfaces this stack has not ported, so they are reproduced
    //! through equivalent ported observables rather than copied assertion for
    //! assertion:
    //!
    //! - The basic case asserts `lockoutDays() == 0` and
    //!   `applyObservationShift() == false`; [`OvernightIndexedCoupon`] ships
    //!   neither inspector (both knobs are deferred and constant), so those two
    //!   assertions are dropped and the structural rest kept.
    //! - The gearings/spreads case asserts `gearing()` and `spread()` per coupon;
    //!   the coupon exposes neither accessor, so the broadcast is proved instead
    //!   through `rate()`: against a plain leg, a per-coupon gearing scales the rate
    //!   and a per-coupon spread shifts it, both exactly, over an all-forecast leg.
    //!
    //! `testOvernightLegNPV` (:1022) is not reproduced here: its fixture uses
    //! `makeLeg(Null, 3, false, true, ...)`, i.e. three lockout days and telescopic
    //! value dates (both deferred), over an `InterpolatedZeroCurve<Cubic>` (the
    //! stack's zero curve is linear-only), so its published number cannot be
    //! reproduced with the ported surface. The leg's discount-and-sum over
    //! already-oracle'd coupon amounts lands with the OIS swap (#8.10), as the
    //! issue body notes.
