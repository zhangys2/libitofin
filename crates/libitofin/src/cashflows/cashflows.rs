//! Analytics over a [`Leg`].
//!
//! Port of `ql/cashflows/cashflows.{hpp,cpp}`: the [`CashFlows`] namespace of
//! free functions that inspect a leg's dates, price it off a discount curve,
//! and price it off a single flat yield.
//!
//! ## Oracle
//!
//! `bps` and `npvbps` are called nowhere in the QuantLib test-suite, in any
//! overload, not even through `BondFunctions::`. Nothing stands behind their
//! numbers here: they are checked against the definitions in `cashflows.cpp`
//! and against each other. Each test says which it is.
//!
//! The discount-curve [`npv`](CashFlows::npv) and [`atm_rate`](CashFlows::atm_rate)
//! do have oracles, but none this port can reach yet. `bonds.cpp` drives them
//! through the `BondFunctions::` wrappers: `cleanPrice` and `dirtyPrice` reach
//! `npv` (`bondfunctions.cpp:259`), and `atmRate` reaches `atm_rate`
//! (`:301`, from `bonds.cpp:241` and `:257`). Every one of those call sites
//! takes a `Bond`, for `cashflows()`, `notional(settlement)` and
//! `settlementDate()`, and no `Bond` is ported. The direct calls to the
//! discount-curve `npv` all live in the multiple-reset and inflation test
//! files, which need index machinery this port also does not have.
//!
//! So `npv` is pinned here by an *adaptation*: `cashflows.cpp::testSettings`
//! exercises the `InterestRate` overload with a zero continuous rate, making
//! every discount factor exactly `1.0`, which a flat 0% curve reproduces. The
//! expected values carry over unchanged; the overload under test does not.
//! When the fixed-rate `Bond` lands, pin `npv` and `atm_rate` to the
//! `bondfunctions.cpp` sites above and delete the adaptation.
//!
//! The yield analytics fare better:
//! [`npv_at_yield`](CashFlows::npv_at_yield) is a direct port of
//! `cashflows.cpp::testSettings`, and `bonds.cpp::testExCouponGilt` pins
//! [`solve_yield`](CashFlows::solve_yield), [`duration`](CashFlows::duration)
//! and [`convexity`](CashFlows::convexity) against Bloomberg values.
//! [`basis_point_value`](CashFlows::basis_point_value) and
//! [`yield_value_basis_point`](CashFlows::yield_value_basis_point) are reached
//! by `bonds.cpp::testBasisPointValue` through the `BondFunctions::` wrappers
//! that delegate to them (`bondfunctions.cpp:449` and `:474`), which add a
//! tradability guard and nothing else.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! C++ computes the coupon split twice: `bps` and `atmRate` through a
//! `BPSCalculator` `AcyclicVisitor`, `npvbps` through `coupon_cast`. The port
//! keeps only the `coupon_cast` path ([`CashFlow::as_coupon`]) and runs every
//! analytic off one pass. One consequence: `bps` evaluates the amount of every
//! surviving flow, where the visitor evaluates it only for the flows that are
//! not coupons. A coupon whose [`amount`](CashFlow::amount) fails - a floating
//! one missing its fixing - therefore makes `bps` fail, where C++ returns a
//! number.
//!
//! Each yield analytic has two C++ overloads: one taking an `InterestRate`, one
//! taking the `(Rate, DayCounter, Compounding, Frequency)` it is built from and
//! forwarding. Rust has no overloading and the second carries no behaviour, so
//! only the `InterestRate` form is ported; a caller spells the conversion
//! [`InterestRate::new`], which is fallible where the C++ constructor throws.
//! [`solve_yield`](CashFlows::solve_yield) is the exception: it takes the four
//! pieces, because the rate it would take is the one it is solving for.
//!
//! C++ deletes every constructor to make `CashFlows` a namespace; the port uses
//! an uninhabited type, which cannot be constructed at all.
//!
//! The settlement date is passed as an [`Option`] rather than a null [`Date`],
//! and resolving it against an unset evaluation date is an error rather than a
//! fall back to the system clock (D10). The [`Settings`] travel as an argument
//! (D5).
//!
//! `previousCashFlow` and `nextCashFlow` return iterators into the leg, which
//! the `*Date` and `*Amount` helpers dereference and, in the amount's case,
//! walk on from. The port returns the index instead, `leg.rend()` and
//! `leg.end()` becoming `None`. The `*Amount` helpers likewise return `None`
//! where C++ returns a default-constructed `Real`, which no caller can tell
//! from a genuinely zero flow.
