//! Coupon paying a year-on-year inflation rate.
//!
//! Port of `ql/cashflows/yoyinflationcoupon.{hpp,cpp}` and of the swaplet half
//! of `YoYInflationCouponPricer` (`ql/cashflows/inflationcouponpricer.{hpp,cpp}`).
//! A [`YoYInflationCoupon`] carries a [`YoYInflationIndex`], an observation lag
//! and an interpolation rule, a gearing and spread, and a pricer. As with
//! [`FloatingRateCoupon`] it computes no rate itself: [`rate`](Coupon::rate)
//! requires a pricer, hands the coupon to
//! [`initialize`](YoYInflationCouponPricer::initialize) and returns
//! [`swaplet_rate`](YoYInflationCouponPricer::swaplet_rate)
//! (`inflationcoupon.cpp:69-73`).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! There is no `InflationCoupon` base. C++ needs one so that a single
//! `InflationCouponPricer` interface can serve zero and year-on-year coupons,
//! and pays for it twice: `initialize` recovers the concrete coupon with a
//! `dynamic_cast` (`inflationcouponpricer.cpp:136-138`) and `checkPricerImpl`
//! re-checks the pricer's type at `setPricer` (`yoyinflationcoupon.cpp:55-59`).
//! Here the pricer slot is a `SharedMut<dyn YoYInflationCouponPricer>` keyed on
//! the concrete coupon, so both checks are structural and neither downcast has a
//! port. A base can be lifted out if a `CPICoupon` consumer ever lands.
//!
//! The C++ coupon is a `LazyObject` caching `rate_` (`inflationcoupon.cpp:63-66`).
//! As elsewhere in the cash-flow layer the cache is omitted and the pricer is
//! rerun on each call, which is a pure function of the same inputs. The
//! forwarding half is kept: the coupon rebroadcasts its index, its pricer and
//! the evaluation date to its own observers.
//!
//! The vol-dependent pricers (`Black`/`UnitDisplacedBlack`/`Bachelier`) and the
//! `capletRate`, `floorletRate` and `optionletRate` machinery underneath them
//! landed with `#838`, as
//! [`YoYInflationOptionletCouponPricer`](super::YoYInflationOptionletCouponPricer);
//! only the default-erroring halves of the trait are here. The coupon's own
//! `adjustedFixing()` (`yoyinflationcoupon.hpp:60`, `:89`) stays unported:
//! nothing in `ql/` or `test-suite/` calls it, so it has no behaviour to pin
//! and waits for a caller. `price()`
//! (amount times a discount factor, `inflationcoupon.cpp:91-93`) and the
//! `accept(AcyclicVisitor&)` overrides have no port, as for the other coupons.
