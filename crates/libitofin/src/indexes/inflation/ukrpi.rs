//! The UK Retail Price Index.
//!
//! Port of `ql/indexes/inflation/ukrpi.hpp:33-53`. [`UkRpi`] is the UK retail
//! price inflation index: "RPI" over the [`UK`](Region::uk) region, unrevised,
//! published [`Monthly`](Frequency::Monthly) with a one-month availability lag
//! in [`GBP`](Currency::gbp). It adds no behaviour over [`ZeroInflationIndex`],
//! so [`UkRpi::new`] returns a plain one.
//!
//! [`YyUkRpi`] is its quoted year-on-year sibling `YYUKRPI`
//! (`ukrpi.hpp:42-53`): the same metadata bar the family name, "YY_RPI", and a
//! [`YoYInflationIndex`] rather than a zero one. Quoted, not a ratio - it is
//! published as a year-on-year rate in its own right and keeps its own history.
