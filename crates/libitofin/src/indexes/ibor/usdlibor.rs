//! The USD Libor index.
//!
//! Port of `ql/indexes/ibor/usdlibor.hpp`. `USDLibor` is the US Dollar LIBOR
//! fixed by ICE: the [`Libor`] base configuration with family name
//! "USDLibor", two settlement days, USD, the US LiborImpact calendar as the
//! financial center, and an [`Actual360`] day counter (`usdlibor.hpp:44-50`).
//! Like the base, it is pure configuration: [`UsdLibor::new`] returns a plain
//! [`IborIndex`] whose maturity calendar is the joint UK-Exchange-plus-US
//! calendar.
//!
//! Deferred visibly: `DailyTenorUSDLibor` (needs the `DailyTenorLibor` base,
//! see the deferral note in [`libor`](crate::indexes::ibor::libor)).
