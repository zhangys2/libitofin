//! The Inter-Bank-Offered-Rate index.
//!
//! Port of `ql/indexes/iborindex.{hpp,cpp}`. [`IborIndex`] is the concrete
//! [`InterestRateIndex`] behind the floating leg: an
//! [`InterestRateIndexBase`] plus a business-day convention, an end-of-month
//! flag, and a [`Handle`] to the forwarding [`YieldTermStructure`] it reads
//! fixings off.
//!
//! It supplies the two members the base leaves abstract:
//! [`maturity_date`](InterestRateIndex::maturity_date) advances the value date
//! by the tenor under the index convention, and
//! [`forecast_fixing`](InterestRateIndex::forecast_fixing) derives the simple
//! forward rate from the curve's discount factors between the value and
//! maturity dates. The index registers its forwarding observer with the curve
//! handle, so a relinked or changed curve notifies the index's observers.
//!
//! [`OvernightIndex`] lives here too, as it does in `iborindex.hpp`: an
//! [`IborIndex`] pinned to the overnight configuration (one-day tenor,
//! `Following`, no end-of-month).
