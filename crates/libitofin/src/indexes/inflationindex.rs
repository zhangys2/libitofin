//! Inflation indexes.
//!
//! Port of `ql/indexes/inflationindex.{hpp,cpp}`'s `InflationIndex`
//! (`inflationindex.hpp:87`) and [`ZeroInflationIndex`]
//! (`inflationindex.hpp:156`), plus the `inflationPeriod` free function they
//! and every inflation term structure depend on, and the [`Cpi`] observation
//! conventions (`inflationindex.hpp:39`) that read a lagged fixing off a
//! [`ZeroInflationIndex`].
//!
//! An inflation index is not a rate index: it has no tenor, no fixing days and
//! no value-date algebra, so it derives from [`Index`] directly rather than
//! from [`InterestRateIndex`](super::InterestRateIndex) - whose name
//! composition (tenor plus day counter) would key the D11 fixing store on the
//! wrong shape. The name here is `region.name() + " " + family_name`
//! (`inflationindex.cpp:131`), i.e. `"UK RPI"`, and that string *is* the store
//! key.
//!
//! Shared state lives in [`InflationIndexBase`], which a concrete inflation
//! index embeds and hands back through
//! [`inflation_base`](InflationIndex::inflation_base); the inspectors are
//! provided against it. Unlike [`InterestRateIndex`](super::InterestRateIndex),
//! the [`Index`] surface is *not* filled in by a blanket impl: a second
//! `impl<T: InflationIndex> Index for T` would overlap the existing
//! `impl<T: InterestRateIndex> Index for T` and fail coherence. A concrete
//! inflation index therefore writes its own `impl Index`, delegating to the
//! base (see [`InflationIndexBase::add_fixing`] for the one delegation that
//! carries behaviour and must not be forgotten).
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - **No `referenceDate_` member.** `inflationindex.hpp:139` declares one that
//!   the base never reads or writes; it is omitted rather than carried dead.
//! - **`forceOverwrite` dropped**, as on [`Index::add_fixing`]: the D11 store
//!   rejects a conflicting value and accepts an identical one, and has no
//!   overwrite mode to switch on.
//! - **No `interpolated_` member on [`YoYInflationIndex`]**. C++ declares one
//!   (`inflationindex.hpp:253`), deprecated in 1.43, that nothing ever assigns:
//!   it is `false` at declaration and no constructor, subclass or setter moves
//!   it. Its four readers are the branches of `pastFixing`, `needsForecast` and
//!   `forecastFixing` ported here (`inflationindex.cpp:304,335,353,376`) plus
//!   the `AsIndex` arm of `detail::CPI::effectiveInterpolationType`
//!   (`:417`), and `AsIndex` is itself unported (see
//!   [`CpiInterpolationType`]). The field is therefore carried neither as
//!   state nor as an `interpolated()` inspector, and only the live
//!   non-interpolated branch of each of those three methods is ported.
//! - **`inflationYearFraction` is homed here**, beside [`inflation_period`],
//!   where C++ declares it with the term structures
//!   (`inflationtermstructure.hpp:247`). It is the same period-quantizing
//!   date arithmetic as its neighbour, and the zero index's forecast is its
//!   only caller so far.
