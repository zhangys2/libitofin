//! Base bond instrument.
//!
//! Port of `ql/instruments/bond.{hpp,cpp}`: the abstract [`Bond`] an
//! interest-rate bond derives from. It is an [`Instrument`] holding a [`Leg`]
//! of cash flows, a notional schedule and a number of settlement days, and it
//! prices through a [`Bond::engine`](BondEngine) that returns a settlement
//! value.
//!
//! `Bond` has no standalone oracle: it is abstract, and the numbers are pinned
//! by the derived `FixedRateBond` + `DiscountingBondEngine` against
//! `bonds.cpp`. This module ports the interface header-faithfully.
//!
//! Deviations, all by existing design decisions:
//! - The `Bond::arguments`, `Bond::results` and `Bond::engine` inner classes
//!   become the free [`BondArguments`], [`BondResults`] and [`BondEngine`].
//! - The C++ `Date()`/`Null<Real>` sentinels for an unset issue date, maturity
//!   and settlement value become [`Option`] (D4/D5).
//! - `settlementDate`, `notional` and the price accessors read the evaluation
//!   date from the [`Settings`] handle the bond is built with (D5); with none
//!   set they return an error rather than the C++ system-clock fall back (D10).
//! - The methods delegating to `BondFunctions`/`CashFlows` -
//!   [`is_expired`](Instrument::is_expired) and
//!   [`accrued_amount`](Bond::accrued_amount) - call [`CashFlows`] directly, the
//!   port's home for those analytics.
//! - The price-fed [`Bond::yield_rate`] and [`BondPrice`] land here (#290),
//!   solver-backed through `BondFunctions`. The engine-priced
//!   `Bond::yield(dayCounter, ...)` overload, the price-from-yield
//!   `cleanPrice`/`dirtyPrice`, the coupon-rate and cash-flow-date inspectors,
//!   `setSingleRedemption` and the `faceAmount` constructor remain follow-up
//!   work.
