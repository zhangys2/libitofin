//! Standard market year-on-year inflation cap/floor builder
//! (`MakeYoYInflationCapFloor`).
//!
//! Port of `ql/instruments/makeyoyinflationcapfloor.{hpp,cpp}`: the comfortable
//! way to instantiate a standard market [`YoYInflationCapFloor`]. It derives an
//! annual year-on-year leg from a length in years, a [`YoYInflationIndex`] and a
//! forward start, trims that leg to the optionlets asked for, and strikes it
//! either at an explicit rate or at the money off a nominal curve
//! (`makeyoyinflationcapfloor.cpp:46-89`).
//!
//! ## Trimming happens before the at-the-money fill
//!
//! [`build`](MakeYoYInflationCapFloor::build) drops coupons *before* it resolves
//! an at-the-money strike (`cpp:69-83`):
//! [`with_first_caplet_excluded`](MakeYoYInflationCapFloor::with_first_caplet_excluded)
//! drops the front optionlet, [`as_optionlet`](MakeYoYInflationCapFloor::as_optionlet)
//! keeps only the last, and the strike is then the rate that reprices whatever
//! survives. Filling the strike first would strike a one-coupon optionlet at the
//! whole leg's rate, which is a different instrument on any curve with slope.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - The explicit-strike/at-the-money conflict is a *build*-time error rather
//!   than a setter error. C++ guards it at both setters (`cpp:133` "ATM strike
//!   already given", `cpp:141` "explicit strike already given"), which a
//!   consumed-self fluent setter returning `Self` cannot do. [`build`] refuses
//!   the both-given case instead, and also the neither-given case, which C++
//!   reaches as a dereference of its empty nominal-curve handle. The two agree
//!   on which builders are legal; they differ only in when the refusal lands.
//! - `withFirstCapletExcluded` is *declared* upstream (`hpp:49`) and defined in
//!   no translation unit, so calling it in C++ fails to link, even though
//!   `build` reads the flag it would have set (`cpp:69-70`). The port implements
//!   a working setter.
//!
//! [`build`]: MakeYoYInflationCapFloor::build
