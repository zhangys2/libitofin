//! Zero-coupon inflation-indexed swap.
//!
//! Port of `ql/instruments/zerocouponinflationswap.{hpp,cpp}`: `class
//! ZeroCouponInflationSwap : public Swap` (`zerocouponinflationswap.hpp:68`),
//! quoted as a fixed rate `K` that at inception matches the inflation growth,
//!
//! ```text
//! P_n(0,T) N [(1+K)^T - 1] = P_n(0,T) N [I(T)/I(0) - 1]
//! ```
//!
//! Both legs hold exactly one flow, swapped at maturity: a
//! [`SimpleCashFlow`] for the fixed side and a [`ZeroInflationCashFlow`] for the
//! indexed one. Nothing accrues, so neither flow is a coupon and no schedule is
//! needed. The passed [`SwapType`] refers to the *inflation* leg: a
//! [`Payer`](SwapType::Payer) pays inflation and receives fixed
//! (`zerocouponinflationswap.cpp:103-114`).
//!
//! A zero-coupon inflation swap is simple enough that the plain
//! [`DiscountingSwapEngine`](crate::pricingengines::DiscountingSwapEngine)
//! prices it; this ticket adds no engine of its own.
//!
//! ## What the constructor fixes
//!
//! - `growth_only` is hard-coded `true` (`cpp:79`): a swap exchanges growth, not
//!   notionals, so the indexed flow pays `N (I(T)/I(0) - 1)`.
//! - The two payment dates are the maturity adjusted on each side's calendar and
//!   convention (`cpp:76-77`), but the year fraction `T` behind the fixed amount
//!   is taken on the **raw, unadjusted** member dates (`cpp:92`, reading
//!   `maturityDate_` which `cpp:50` stores pre-adjustment). A maturity that lands
//!   on a weekend therefore pays on the following business day while still
//!   accruing to the weekend date.
//! - [`start_date`](Self::start_date) and [`maturity_date`](Self::maturity_date)
//!   report those raw dates (`hpp:93-94`), overriding the base
//!   [`Swap`]'s min/max over the legs, which would answer the adjusted payment
//!   date for both.
//!
//! ## Divergences from QuantLib
//!
//! - C++ recovers the indexed flow in `fairRate` with a
//!   `dynamic_pointer_cast<IndexedCashFlow>` and requires the cast to succeed
//!   (`cpp:124-126`). The port keeps the typed
//!   [`Shared<ZeroInflationCashFlow>`](ZeroInflationCashFlow) the constructor
//!   built (D3: `Rc` has no projection and this crate does not downcast), so the
//!   cast and its failure branch have no counterpart.
//! - `detail::CPI::effectiveInterpolationType` (`cpp:57`) reduces to the identity
//!   here: it exists to fold the deprecated `AsIndex` into `Flat`, and `AsIndex`
//!   is deliberately unported (see [`CpiInterpolationType`]). The compatibility
//!   check is therefore a plain match on the two live variants.
//! - `infCalendar`/`infConvention` are taken as [`Option`]s rather than as C++'s
//!   empty `Calendar()` / default `BusinessDayConvention()` sentinels, which the
//!   port has no equivalent of. They are stored *resolved* to the fixed-leg ones
//!   when unset, which is what C++ does too - it assigns to the members at
//!   `cpp:71-74`, so its own `inflationCalendar()` accessor already returns the
//!   resolved value.
//! - `registerWith(inflationCashFlow)` (`cpp:101`) has no explicit counterpart:
//!   [`Swap::new`] registers with every flow of every leg, which covers it.
//! - The evaluation-date [`Settings`] handle is passed in (D5), as every other
//!   swap in the crate takes it.
//!
//! ## Deferred
//!
//! - `adjustInfObsDates = true`. The flag only ever gates a branch this port does
//!   not have, so it is omitted from the signature rather than accepted and
//!   ignored; a caller needing adjusted observation dates fails to compile.
//!   `adjustObservationDates()` goes with it.
//! - The nested `arguments`/`engine` types (`hpp:146-154`). Nothing populates
//!   them: there is no `setupArguments` override in the C++ translation unit, so
//!   the instrument reuses the generic [`SwapArguments`]/[`SwapResults`]
//!   machinery and the extra `fixedRate` argument field is never read.
//! - The [`Receiver`](SwapType::Receiver) side is pinned structurally (its NPV is
//!   the [`Payer`](SwapType::Payer)'s negated) rather than by its own hand-derived
//!   numbers.
//!
