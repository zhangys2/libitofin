//! ISDA credit-default-swap pricing engine.
//!
//! Port of `ql/pricingengines/credit/isdacdsengine.{hpp,cpp}`: [`IsdaCdsEngine`]
//! prices a [`CreditDefaultSwap`](crate::instruments::CreditDefaultSwap) the way
//! the ISDA standard model does, integrating both legs over the pillar dates of
//! the two curves it is built with rather than over the premium schedule alone.
//! Three flags - [`NumericalFix`], [`AccrualBias`] and
//! [`ForwardsInCouponPeriod`] - select which of that model's known
//! approximations the engine reproduces, so that it can be graded against the
//! standard model's C code and not only against the theory. They are documented
//! against the two references named at `isdacdsengine.hpp:36-47`: [1] OpenGamma's
//! note on the ISDA model and [2] Markit's proposed numerical fix.
//!
//! The model is specified against curves of a fixed shape, so the engine refuses
//! anything else outright (`isdacdsengine.cpp:62-98`).
//!
//! Deviations, documented per D5/D10:
//! - The C++ global `Settings::instance()` (`isdacdsengine.cpp:70`) becomes an
//!   explicit [`Settings`] handle the engine is built with, as for
//!   [`MidPointCdsEngine`](super::MidPointCdsEngine); an unset evaluation date is
//!   an `Err` rather than a system-clock fall back.
//! - The three range checks on the flags (`isdacdsengine.cpp:54-60`) have no
//!   counterpart: they reject a `NumericalFix` that is neither `None` nor
//!   `Taylor`, which a C++ enum permits and a Rust one does not.
//! - The C++ `dynamic_pointer_cast<FixedRateCoupon>` on each premium flow
//!   (`isdacdsengine.cpp:205`) becomes
//!   [`CashFlow::as_coupon`](crate::cashflow::CashFlow::as_coupon), as it does for
//!   [`MidPointCdsEngine`](super::MidPointCdsEngine): C++ dereferences the
//!   resulting null pointer when a flow is not a coupon and the port reports it
//!   (D4). The narrowing stops at `dyn Coupon` rather than at the fixed-rate
//!   coupon, which is every member the kernel reads; a floating-rate coupon in
//!   the leg would therefore price here where C++ is undefined.
//! - The C++ `default:` arm of the side switch (`isdacdsengine.cpp:322-323`) has
//!   no counterpart: [`ProtectionSide`] has exactly the two variants, so there
//!   is no unknown side to reject.

    //! value is arrived at without walking anything, which is what makes it an
    //! oracle for the walk rather than a restatement of it.
    //!
    //! The discount curve is interpolated rather than flat even though it prices
    //! flat: `isda_node_grid` takes the grid from the curves' own pillars, so

/// The oracle the Python `IsdaCdsEngine` facade (#812) is pinned against: a

/// date, priced through the instrument the way a caller prices one.
///
/// The fixture lives here rather than only in the binding because the pinned
/// number has to come out of the constructor the facade wraps.
/// `crates/itofin-py/tests/test_isda_cds.py` rebuilds it byte-for-byte - the
/// same dates, curves, schedule and contract terms - and asserts the same three
/// literals, so a facade that reached a different engine, or dropped one of the
/// arguments it forwards, shows up there as a mismatch rather than as a
/// plausible number nothing grades.
///
/// The schedule is built through the same builder calls `PySchedule::new`
/// (`itofin-py/src/time.rs:528-536`) makes, including the rule and the
/// termination convention the refusal fixture leaves defaulted, and its shape
/// is asserted alongside the value so a drift in the dates is told apart from a
/// drift in the pricing. Two flat curves leave the integration grid as the
/// maturity alone (`isdanodegrid.rs:122-124`), so this is a single-node ISDA
/// reprice - still the engine's own kernels, and still distinct from the
/// mid-point engine's period-by-period integration.
