//! The ISDA integration grid: the union of the curves' own node dates.
//!
//! Port of the node-collection prologue of `IsdaCdsEngine::calculate`
//! (`ql/pricingengines/credit/isdacdsengine.cpp:104-156`). The ISDA model
//! integrates the protection and premium legs over the pillar dates of the
//! discount and credit curves themselves, so the engine must recover each
//! curve's concrete type from the abstract handle it was given.
//!
//! ## The downcast seam
//!
//! C++ does this with `dynamic_pointer_cast` down a class hierarchy. `Rc`
//! carries no such projection, so the port routes it through
//! [`YieldTermStructure::as_any`] /
//! [`DefaultProbabilityTermStructure::as_any`]: a curve that can expose its
//! nodes returns `Some(self)`, every other curve keeps the `None` default and
//! lands in the `QL_FAIL` arm.
//!
//! One C++ cast has no Rust counterpart and so is spelled out twice here. A
//! `PiecewiseYieldCurve<Discount, LogLinear>` *is* an
//! `InterpolatedDiscountCurve<LogLinear>` in C++ (the traits pick the base
//! class), so the engine's single cast catches both the hand-built curve and
//! the bootstrapped one. This port composes rather than inherits - the
//! piecewise curve holds its own `CurveData` and implements the term-structure
//! traits itself - so each bootstrapped curve needs its own arm. Omitting them
//! would reject exactly the curves the ISDA engine exists to price.
//!
//! ## Faithful rejections
//!
//! The arms are a one-to-one transcription of the C++ cascade, so the curve
//! shapes it refuses are refused here too, by construction rather than by
//! oversight: `InterpolatedDiscountCurve<Linear>` is a different C++ type from
//! `InterpolatedDiscountCurve<LogLinear>` and matches no arm, and there is no
//! `InterpolatedZeroCurve` arm at all, so a `PiecewiseYieldCurve<ZeroYield, _>`
//! is an error on both sides. Both fall to the same `QL_FAIL` C++ reaches
//! (`isdacdsengine.cpp:128-129` on the yield side, `:146-147` on the credit
//! side) - the rejection is the ported behaviour, not a missing feature.
