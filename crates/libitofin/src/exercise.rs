//! Option exercise classes.
//!
//! Port of `ql/exercise.{hpp,cpp}`: the [`Exercise`] trait is the base exercise
//! contract, [`EuropeanExercise`] its single-date implementation,
//! [`AmericanExercise`] the continuous `[earliest, latest]` one and
//! [`BermudanExercise`] the sorted multi-date one.
//!
//! Divergence: C++ puts the `payoffAtExpiry` flag on an intermediate
//! `EarlyExercise` base (`exercise.hpp:57-65`). Rust has no class hierarchy to
//! inherit it from, so the flag is a defaulted
//! [`payoff_at_expiry`](Exercise::payoff_at_expiry) on the trait itself,
//! reporting `false` for every exercise that is not an early one - which is
//! what the C++ engines see when their `dynamic_pointer_cast<EarlyExercise>`
//! is not attempted.
//!
//! Deferred, omitted visibly rather than accepted and ignored:
//! - **the Bermudan simulation grid of the Monte Carlo engines**
//!   (`mclongstaffschwartzengine.hpp:218-231`). [`BermudanExercise`] itself is
//!   ported and prices under the finite-difference engine; only the path
//!   generator that would exercise it along a simulated path is missing.
//! - **the latest-date-only `AmericanExercise` constructor**
//!   (`exercise.cpp:43-50`): it opens the window at `Date::minDate()`, a
//!   sentinel this stack has no date for.
