# itofin-optimize

SciPy-inspired numerical optimization in Rust, over plain `f64` slices.

## Scope

A general-purpose `minimize` for Nelder-Mead, BFGS, L-BFGS-B and SLSQP, with an
`Objective` trait carrying its own error type, explicit budgets, a cancellation
hook and validated inputs. All four Rust solvers use the single `minimize`
entry point. C, Go, and Python expose the same four methods.

## Independent of libitofin

This crate is finance-independent and never depends on `libitofin`, in either
direction of the workspace. Its only runtime dependency is `thiserror`. The
QuantLib-ported optimizers in `libitofin::math::optimization` are a separate,
untouched code path.

## Acceptance policy

A solver is accepted on objective quality, feasibility and optimality conditions
within stated tolerances. It is never accepted on reproducing a SciPy trajectory
step for step: identical iterate sequences are not a goal, and a test asserting
one would be testing SciPy's arithmetic order rather than this implementation.

Reference values come from `scripts/fixtures/optimize/gen_fixtures.py`, which
records the SciPy version and the generation date into every fixture it writes.

## Release

The initial **0.36.0** publication is available on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/itofin-optimize/0.36.0). Bootstrap and the
GitHub trusted-publisher configuration are verified:

- Owner `benbenbang`, repository `libitofin`, workflow `semantic-release.yml`;
  no GitHub environment is configured for the Rust publish jobs.
- Future coordinated releases publish `itofin-optimize` before `libitofin`, using
  the same released tag, committed-version checks and OIDC authentication.
  Optimizer publication failure blocks core publication.
- Python and Go release jobs remain independently gated by the release; their
  existing artifacts bundle optimizer code without an additional runtime install.
- CI dry runs perform no publication. The first successful future CI publication
  is still pending; [#1091](https://github.com/benbenbang/libitofin/issues/1091)
  remains open until it is verified. That issue retains historical bootstrap details.

See [Trusted Publishing](https://crates.io/docs/trusted-publishing) for authentication
and the [Cargo publishing guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html)
for package validation.
