# itofin-optimize

SciPy-inspired numerical optimization in Rust, over plain `f64` slices.

## Scope

A general-purpose `minimize` for Nelder-Mead, BFGS, L-BFGS-B and SLSQP, with an
`Objective` trait carrying its own error type, explicit budgets, a cancellation
hook and validated inputs. All four Rust solvers use the single `minimize`
entry point. L-BFGS-B bindings are tracked in issue #1086.

## Independent of libitofin

This crate is finance-independent and never depends on `libitofin`, in either
direction of the workspace. Its only runtime dependency is `thiserror`. The
QuantLib-ported optimizers in `libitofin::math::optimization` are a separate,
untouched code path.

## Acceptance policy

A solver is accepted on objective quality, feasibility and optimality conditions
within stated tolerances. It is never accepted on reproducing a SciPy trajectory
step for step: identical iterate sequences are not a goal, and a test asserting
one would be testing SciPy's arithmetic order rather than this implementation.

Reference values come from `scripts/fixtures/optimize/gen_fixtures.py`, which
records the SciPy version and the generation date into every fixture it writes.

## Release

The first crates.io publish of `itofin-optimize` is manual, done by the
maintainer with a token: crates.io Trusted Publishing requires a first manual
release before it can take over. The CI publish job is added only afterwards, so
that the release workflow does not turn red once `libitofin` has already been
published.
