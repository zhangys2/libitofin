# itofin-optimize

SciPy-inspired numerical optimization in Rust, over plain `f64` slices.

## Scope

A general-purpose `minimize` for Nelder-Mead, BFGS, L-BFGS-B, SLSQP and
Differential-Evolution, with an
`Objective` trait carrying its own error type, explicit budgets, a cancellation
hook and validated inputs. All five Rust solvers use the single `minimize`
entry point. C, Go, and Python expose the same five methods.

Differential-Evolution is serial deferred-generation DE/rand/1/bin. It requires
finite-width box bounds and minimizes signed scalar values directly. Seed zero
is deterministic. It stops only when both box-normalized physical population
spread and absolute value spread satisfy their tolerances. Population convergence
is not a guarantee of global optimality. Equal-valued trials are accepted, and
out-of-box mutant coordinates are resampled uniformly. No polishing, gradients,
general constraints, alternative strategies or parallel workers are supplied.

## Independent of libitofin

This crate is finance-independent and never depends on `libitofin`. Its only
runtime dependency is `thiserror`. The finance crate depends on this crate to
adapt global search to calibration; existing QuantLib-ported local optimizers
remain separate and unchanged.

## Acceptance policy

A solver is accepted on objective quality, feasibility and optimality conditions
within stated tolerances. It is never accepted on reproducing a SciPy trajectory
step for step: identical iterate sequences are not a goal, and a test asserting
one would be testing SciPy's arithmetic order rather than this implementation.

Reference values come from `scripts/fixtures/optimize/gen_fixtures.py`, which
records the SciPy version and the generation date into every fixture it writes.

## Release

This fork does not publish `itofin-optimize` through `semantic-release.yml`.
The crate bundles the workspace BSD-3-Clause `LICENSE`. Upstream's crates.io
releases, including 0.37.0, are separate publications from `benbenbang/libitofin`.
