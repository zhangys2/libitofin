//! Facade for the currency specification Currency.
//!
//! An index carries a currency, so the general IborIndex constructor cannot be
//! called without one. Only the four named currencies the core provides are
//! exposed as staticmethods; the general Currency.new() form is deliberately
//! omitted, since the core itself ports only the currencies the indexes need
//! and the full `ql/currencies/*` catalogue is deferred there.
//!
//! It is registered under `itofin.indexes` rather than a submodule of its own:
//! the index constructors are its only consumers today, both the general
//! IborIndex one and, since #868, SwapIndex, which used to hard-code EUR.
