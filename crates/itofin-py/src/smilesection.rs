//! Facade for SabrSmileSection, a single option expiry's volatility smile at
//! fixed Hagan SABR parameters.
//!
//! The core `SmileSection` trait is not exposed as a Python base class: the SABR
//! section is the only implementor a caller of this crate has a constructor for,
//! so the queries it needs are re-exported here directly rather than through an
//! abstract parent that would have exactly one child.
//!
//! Only the exercise-time constructor is wrapped, as the SABR cube's own
//! sections are: the date-anchored form differs from it only in computing the
//! exercise time from a reference date and a day counter, which a caller can do
//! with `DayCounter.year_fraction`.
//!
//! Deferred (visible): normal (Bachelier) SABR volatility and a non-zero
//! lognormal shift are rejected by the core constructor, both under #586, so the
//! arguments are accepted here and the core's error surfaces as an
//! `ItofinError`.
