//! Facades for the two credit-default-swap engines: MidPointCdsEngine and
//! IsdaCdsEngine.
//!
//! The mid-point engine prices each live premium period of a CreditDefaultSwap
//! against the default probability over that period, placing the default at the
//! period's mid-point, and discounts on a separate yield curve. The ISDA engine
//! prices the same contract the way the ISDA standard model does, integrating
//! both legs over the pillar dates of the two curves rather than over the
//! premium schedule alone.
//!
//! Deferred (visible): the core's `include_settlement_date_flows` override is
//! not exposed on either engine and is always passed as `None`, so the
//! settlement-date flow decision follows the settings' own flags - the shape
//! the C++ cached-value fixture uses (`creditdefaultswap.cpp:96`).
