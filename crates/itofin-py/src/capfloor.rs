//! Facades for the cap/floor stack: the CapFloorType flag and the CapFloor
//! instrument.
//!
//! A cap or floor reaches Python two ways. The standard market builder
//! MakeCapFloor backs the constructor: a tenor, an ibor index, a single strike
//! and a forward start, the shape the core's own market fixtures use. It
//! derives the floating leg off `MakeVanillaSwap`, so a zero `forward_start`
//! drops the spot caplet (`makecapfloor.cpp:34`): the cap needs no historical
//! fixing at the evaluation date, which is what makes it buildable under the
//! explicit-fixings design (D5/D11).
//!
//! The core's raw cap, floor and collar constructors back the three
//! staticmethods instead. They take a leg of concrete `IborCoupon`s,
//! which IborLeg now builds (#626), so a leg laid out coupon by coupon - its
//! own notional, day counter and fixing days, spot caplet kept - can be capped
//! from Python. That is the only route to a collar on this side: MakeCapFloor
//! carries a single strike and refuses one outright.
//!
//! Deferred (visible): the general constructor taking a type flag with both
//! strike vectors, which the three named constructors cover between them, and
//! the leg accessors on a built instrument beyond coupon_count().
