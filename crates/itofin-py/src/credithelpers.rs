//! Facades for the credit bootstrap helpers: the DefaultProbabilityHelper base
//! and the concrete SpreadCdsHelper.
//!
//! The credit twin of helpers(), which carries the yield-side rate helpers,
//! split the same way the core splits them: a credit helper fits a
//! default-probability curve, not a yield curve, so it implements a separate
//! trait and cannot share the RateHelper base. The base holds the helper
//! already upcast and type-erased, and the concrete subclasses supply only
//! their constructors, mirroring the credit() base/subclass idiom.
//!
//! `UpfrontCdsHelper` (`defaultprobabilityhelpers.hpp:170`) has no core port yet
//! and is omitted here rather than stubbed; it follows within EPIC Credit
//! (#676).
