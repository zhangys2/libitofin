//! Facades for the optionlet (caplet/floorlet) volatility stack: the
//! OptionletVolatilityStructure base, the constant surface
//! ConstantOptionletVolatility, and the stripping pair OptionletStripper1 /
//! StrippedOptionletAdapter that turns market cap term volatilities into a
//! caplet surface.
//!
//! The base holds the surface type-erased and exposes the queries every
//! concrete surface inherits; concrete surfaces
//! subclass it and supply only their constructor. They build the base through
//! from_handle() rather than a struct literal, so the surfaces stacking on it
//! in later tickets never need access to the private field.
//!
//! Unlike the swaption surfaces, an optionlet surface has a single option axis:
//! a query takes one option tenor (or date) and a strike, not an option/swap
//! tenor pair.
//!
//! The constant surface exposes both reference-date families (#627): `new` and
//! `with_quote` pin the reference date, while `moving` and `moving_with_quote`
//! float it off the `Settings` evaluation date by a settlement-day count on a
//! calendar, as for the constant swaption surface.
