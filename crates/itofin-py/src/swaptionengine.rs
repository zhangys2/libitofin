//! Facade for the Black-style swaption pricing engines: CashAnnuityModel,
//! BlackSwaptionEngine and BachelierSwaptionEngine.
//!
//! The core engine is generic over a formula spec, which does not cross FFI
//! (D7), so both spec instantiations - the shifted-lognormal
//! `BlackSwaptionEngine` alias and the normal `BachelierSwaptionEngine` alias -
//! are wrapped as concrete classes here.
