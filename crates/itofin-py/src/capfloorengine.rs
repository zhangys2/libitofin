//! Facade for the Black cap/floor pricing engine: BlackCapFloorEngine.
//!
//! The engine prices each optionlet of a CapFloor with the Black 1976 formula
//! over an optionlet volatility surface, discounting on a separate yield curve.
//!
//! Both core constructors are exposed. The surface form takes a
//! OptionletVolatilityStructure and an optional displacement; the flat-vol form
//! takes a single quote and wraps it in a moving constant surface with zero
//! settlement days on a null calendar, so that surface's reference date IS the
//! evaluation date carried by `settings`.
//!
//! Deferred (visible): the Bachelier cap/floor engine is not exposed - the core
//! prices only the shifted-lognormal path, so a normal-volatility surface is
//! rejected by the constructor rather than bound to a second engine here.
