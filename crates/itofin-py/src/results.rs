//! The frozen `Results` snapshot the instrument facades hand back.
//!
//! Every instrument caches the outputs of its last valuation, and the live
//! accessors (`npv()`, the greeks, `fair_rate()`, ...) re-run the lazy
//! calculation whenever an observed input moved. `Results` is the opposite: a
//! plain copy of those outputs taken at one moment, which no later input
//! change can move.

/// view: once taken, an input change reprices the instrument's live accessors
/// and leaves the snapshot reporting the valuation it was taken from.

/// Every field is optional because the core stores it that way - an engine
/// fills what it computes and leaves the rest unset. The analytic European
/// engine, for one, provides a value but neither an error estimate nor a
/// valuation date.

/// additional_results is REAL-ONLY: the core keeps the engine's extra outputs
/// behind a type-erased handle whose only sanctioned downcast is to a real, so
/// tags holding anything else are OMITTED from the dict rather than guessed
