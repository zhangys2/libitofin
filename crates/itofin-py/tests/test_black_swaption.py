"""Oracle for the swaption vol-structure + Black-engine facade (issue #612).

The bindings oracle is the wrapped Rust numbers, and this pass proves the
CONSTRUCTION is right rather than reproducing a swap NPV literal: the core's
``blackswaptionengine.rs`` fixture is built with ``MakeVanillaSwap``, which has
no Python facade yet, so its literal belongs to a later ticket.

Three pins, all on one shared ``Settings`` (the engine, the swap and the
swaption must agree on the evaluation date or the NPV is silently wrong):

A. ``ConstantSwaptionVolatility`` returns the constructed vol for any query.
B. ``BlackSwaptionEngine(surface)`` and ``BlackSwaptionEngine.with_flat_vol``
   price the same swaption identically. ``with_flat_vol`` wraps the quote in a
   moving constant surface with 0 settlement days on a null calendar, so its
   reference date IS the evaluation date - the same surface arm A builds with a
   fixed reference at that date. The two routes run the identical float
   sequence, so they are pinned bit-for-bit, not to a tolerance.
C. The same swaption on a surface referenced a month later prices differently.
   The vol level is constant, so the NPV moves only through the option time
   ``day_count(reference_date, exercise)``: a later reference shortens it,
   shrinking the variance and the premium. This is what makes B non-degenerate -
   it proves the reference date the two routes agree on is load-bearing.

Every arm rebuilds its own swap and swaption. An ``Instrument`` caches its NPV,
and the engine silently installs its own discounting engine on the swap it
prices, so reusing one swaption across the three engines would let arm B pass on
a stale cached number.
