"""Oracle for the interpolated ATM swaption vol matrix facade (issue #613).

The fixture is the core module test's, in turn QuantLib's
``swaptionvolstructuresutilities.hpp`` grid: TARGET, ModifiedFollowing,
Actual/365F, option tenors [1M,6M,1Y,5Y,10Y,30Y] x swap tenors [1Y,5Y,10Y,30Y]
and the 6x4 vols, all read against evaluation date 15-June-2026.

Three arms:

A. Node recovery on the fixed-reference constructor. Bilinear is exact at the
   nodes, so all 24 come back; the core asserts 1e-16 and this pass keeps 1e-12.
   The query strike is 0.05, not the core's 0.0, so it also pins that the ATM
   grid range-checks the strike and then ignores it.
B. Quote-bump refresh on the moving constructor. Reading a node, bumping its
   quote and re-reading pins the observer chain end to end through Python: an
   interpolation built once and never rebuilt serves the stale vol. Bumping a
   DIFFERENT node's quote and re-reading the first pins that the grid rebuilds
   from the quotes rather than flooding one value across the lattice.
C. Engine integration. The same swaption priced on the matrix and on a
   ``ConstantSwaptionVolatility`` at the vol the matrix serves for that
   swaption's own coordinates must agree.

   Arm C's coincidence is exact by construction, not to a tolerance. The engine
   reads ``black_variance(exercise_date, swap_length, strike)``, i.e.
   ``vol^2 * time_from_reference(exercise_date)``; both surfaces are Act/365F off
   15-June-2026 with a zero shift, so given the same vol the two routes run the
   identical float sequence over the identical swap, curve and annuity.

   The coordinates are made to line up rather than assumed. EXERCISE is built by
   advancing EVAL 2Y on TARGET/ModifiedFollowing, which is exactly what the
   surface's own tenor-to-date conversion does, so ``volatility(2Y, ...)`` reads
   the engine's option date. The swap runs EXERCISE to EXERCISE+7y = 2556 days,
   and the engine's ``swap_length`` rounds ``2556/365.25*12 = 83.98`` to 84
   months = 7.0 years exactly, which is what the 7Y swap tenor resolves to.

   2Y x 7Y sits strictly inside the grid but on no node, so the matrix must
   interpolate: an interpolator that snapped to a node would be caught by
   ``test_the_engine_coordinates_are_off_the_nodes``. What arm C pins is that
   the engine reads THIS surface at the swaption's own coordinates - both sides
   read the interpolated number from the same matrix, so it is not an
   independent check of that number. Arm A and the core's 1e-16 test cover that.
