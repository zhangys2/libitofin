"""Oracle for the instrument ergonomics surface (#882): calculate(),
is_calculated(), the per-facade one-shot price(arg) and the frozen results()
snapshot.

The surface layers over the core's lazy-object contract rather than replacing
it: set_*_engine still only wires the observer and marks the cache stale, and
the valuation still fires on the first accessor. What is new is that the
firing, the cache state and the copied outputs are all sayable from Python.

This file carries the VanillaOption pass. Two things it pins are worth naming.

A. price(process) is exactly set_engine(process) + npv(), same float, one call.
   The equality is bit-exact, not a tolerance: it is the same code path.

B. The evaluation-date arm pins the OBSERVER contract only, and deliberately
   NOT a price change. A VanillaOption registers with the settings evaluation
   date in its constructor (oneassetoption.rs:159), so moving that date does
   invalidate the cache. But BlackScholesProcess builds FIXED-reference curves
   (market.rs:86-100) and the analytic European engine reads every input off
   them by absolute date - black_variance_date, discount_date, reference_date
   (pricingengines/vanilla/mod.rs:105-133). The evaluation date therefore never
   enters this engine's price, and the recalculation reproduces the old NPV
   BIT FOR BIT. Asserting a moved price here would be asserting something
   false. The genuine frozen-copy discriminator, which needs an input the price
   really depends on, lives on CapFloor in this file's second pass.

   The moved date must also stay well inside the option's life. Past expiry the
   core short-circuits to setup_expired() and reports a zero NPV, and the arm
   would then pass for entirely the wrong reason.

Also pinned honestly rather than hopefully: the analytic engine fills neither
error_estimate nor valuation_date, so both read None on the snapshot. Its seven
extra outputs are all real-valued, so all seven survive the Real-only
additional_results copy, and the two that the fixture states outright - the
strike and the spot - are checked against the numbers the fixture was built
with, so a snapshot that copied the keys but garbled the values fails.
