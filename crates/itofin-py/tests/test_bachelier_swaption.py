"""Oracle for the normal-vol Bachelier swaption engine facade (issue #616).

The twin of ``test_black_swaption.py``, and for the same reason it pins
CONSTRUCTION rather than an NPV literal: the core has no cached Bachelier
swaption value at all. Its only Bachelier engine test
(``blackswaptionengine.rs:1597``, ``swaption_delta_in_the_bachelier_model``) is
a bump-and-revalue delta self-consistency check reading a greek accessor the
Python facade does not expose, so there is no number to reproduce here.

Three pins, all on one shared ``Settings`` (the engine, the swap and the
swaption must agree on the evaluation date or the NPV is silently wrong):

A. ``BachelierSwaptionEngine(surface)`` and
   ``BachelierSwaptionEngine.with_flat_vol`` price the same swaption
   identically. ``with_flat_vol`` wraps the quote in a MOVING constant surface
   with 0 settlement days on a null calendar, so its reference date IS the
   evaluation date - which is why arm A builds its fixed-reference surface at
   exactly that date. Only then do the two routes run the identical float
   sequence, so they are pinned bit-for-bit rather than to a tolerance.
B. The same swaption on a surface referenced a month later prices differently.
   The vol level is constant, so the NPV moves only through the option time
   ``day_count(reference_date, exercise)``: a later reference shortens it,
   shrinking the variance and the premium. This is what makes arm A
   non-degenerate - it proves the engine prices rather than returning a
   constant, and that the reference date the two routes agree on is
   load-bearing.
C. A ShiftedLognormal surface handed to the Bachelier engine raises at pricing
   time, not construction (the inverse of the Black engine's refusal, and the
   direct mirror of the core test
   ``a_lognormal_volatility_surface_is_refused_by_the_bachelier_engine``,
   ``blackswaptionengine.rs:1344``). The message keys on "requires normal input
   volatility", which the Black refusal does not contain.

The volatility is quoted in absolute rate terms, not as a proportion: 50 bp of
normal vol against a 3% strike, where the lognormal twin quotes 20%.

Every arm rebuilds its own swap and swaption. An ``Instrument`` caches its NPV,
and the engine silently installs its own discounting engine on the swap it
prices, so reusing one swaption across the engines would let arm A pass on a
stale cached number.
