"""InterpolatedHazardRateCurve<BackwardFlat> (#741).

Self-contained hand-integrated oracle, mirroring the Rust one in
crates/libitofin/src/termstructures/credit/interpolatedhazardratecurve.rs
(`hazard_rates_step_between_nodes_and_extrapolate_flat` and
`survival_probabilities_match_the_hand_integrated_step_function`, whose fixture
this copies verbatim).

The nodes sit 0, 360, 720 and 1800 days past the reference date, so under
Actual/360 the node times are exactly 0, 1, 2 and 5. That exactness is itself
the day-count discriminator - under Actual/365Fixed the first node would land
at 0.9863 and every pin below would miss - and it is what makes the hand
integral valid arithmetic rather than an approximation.

Backward-flat reads the RIGHT-hand node on each segment, so the hazard rate is
0.015 on (0, 1], 0.02 on (1, 2] and 0.03 on (2, 5]. The survival probability is
exp(-integral) over that step function.
