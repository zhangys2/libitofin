"""OIS rate-helper bootstrap - facing the overnight strip (#551, #554).

Mirrors the merged core oracle `ois_bootstrap_reprices_the_quotes`
(crates/libitofin/src/termstructures/yields/ratehelpers.rs:1677-1753): an ESTR
discounting curve bootstrapped purely from OISRateHelpers reprices every OIS
quote it was built from.

The reprice arm is the core loop (ratehelpers.rs:1729-1752) ported verbatim:
each quote is repriced by an independently built OvernightIndexedSwap
(MakeOis + fair_rate()) floating off a FRESH Estr forwarding on the
BOOTSTRAPPED curve, not off the empty-handle index the helpers were built with.
That is a real instrument valuation, unlike the helper-level
abs(implied_quote - quote_value) it replaces (#554), which was the bootstrap's
OWN root (bootstraphelper.rs:317) and so re-asserted the solver residual rather
than discriminating a mis-wire.

    """Port of `ois_bootstrap_reprices_the_quotes`. Three arms:

    1. STRUCTURAL PIN: one curve node per helper plus the reference node.
       `dates()` also forces the lazy bootstrap, so the reprice arm below reads a
       solved curve. This arm cannot be faked by the solver.
    2. REPRICE (ratehelpers.rs:1729-1752): every quote is recovered as the fair
       rate of an independently built OIS floating off a fresh Estr on the
       bootstrapped curve. It discriminates the wiring the bootstrap root cannot:
       the payment lag, the averaging method and the fresh-index-on-the-solved-
       curve forwarding each move the fair rate off the quote when mis-set. The
       nominal is asserted separately - fair_rate() is nominal-invariant, so the
       reprice alone would not catch a dropped with_nominal (the core default is
       1.0). Two of the knobs passed here are degenerate under this fixture and
       are NOT pinned, though the core loop passes them too: effective_date,
       because MakeOis derives the same 9-Feb-2009 start from its own two-day
       family default (makeois.rs:526-534 - the ESTR family, not the index's own
       zero settlement days), and discounting_term_structure, because the curve
       passed is already the index's forwarding curve.
    3. SHAPE: discount factors strictly positive and strictly decreasing across
       the (increasing) helper maturity dates - a structural property the solver
       cannot fake.
