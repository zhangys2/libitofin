"""Oracle for the cap/floor + optionlet-vol + Black-engine facades (#621, #626).

Two passes live here. The ``MakeCapFloor`` pass (#621) is SMOKE and STRUCTURAL:
that builder uses a unit nominal and drops the spot caplet, so it cannot
reproduce the core's cached literal and the arms below pin construction and
engine agreement instead.

The raw-leg pass (#626) at the end of this file IS the numeric oracle. The
core's ``blackcapfloorengine.rs`` cached NPV is built over a hand-rolled
``IborLeg`` - notional 100, spot caplet kept - which the ``IborLeg`` facade now
lets Python lay out, so ``CapFloor.cap`` / ``floor`` / ``collar`` reproduce that
literal through the raw constructors. See the section header there.

What is pinned by the MakeCapFloor pass:

A. A 5Y Euribor6M cap at 4% on a flat 5% curve builds, refuses to price with no
   engine, and prices finite and positive once a Black engine is attached; the
   matching floor at 6% prices positive too. The strike reaches the engine: the
   4% cap is worth more than a 6% cap on the same leg.
B. The two engine constructors agree bit-for-bit. ``with_flat_vol`` wraps the
   quote in a MOVING constant optionlet surface with 0 settlement days on a null
   calendar, so its reference date IS the evaluation date - the same surface arm
   B builds explicitly with a fixed reference at that date. The two routes run
   the identical float sequence, so this is an equality, not a tolerance. This is
   what makes the smoke arms construction-pinning without a cached literal.
C. The engine's displacement guard (``blackcapfloorengine.rs:75-82``) is reachable
   from Python: a displacement that differs from the surface's own is an error.
D. ``CapFloorType.Collar`` exists but is refused by this constructor:
   ``MakeCapFloor`` builds caps and floors only. The collar is reachable through
   the raw-leg pass below.

What is pinned by the raw-leg pass:

E. The core's cached cap 6.87570026732 and floor 2.65812927959, to 1e-11, over
   the ``CommonVars`` fixture of ``blackcapfloorengine.rs:304-418``: it is
   14-Mar-2002, a flat 5% Actual360 continuously compounded curve references
   18-Mar-2002, Euribor 6M forecasts off it, and the leg runs 20 years
   semiannually on TARGET, ModifiedFollowing at both ends, generated forwards,
   on a notional of 100 with two fixing days and the index's own day counter.
   The engine is Black at a flat 20% vol. The par arm is the one pinned:
   ``using_at_par`` defaults true, so no flag is passed.
F. That the raw-leg path is what produced them, but only in part. The literal
   pins the notional (``MakeCapFloor`` uses a unit nominal, so that mis-wire is
   off by a factor of 100), the schedule the coupons are laid on, and that the
   default coupon pricer was attached - without it the rate query errors rather
   than pricing. It does NOT pin everything the leg carries, and the three arms
   below cover what it misses. Read F as the floor of what E proves, not the
   ceiling.
G. The collar, as the cap less the floor, and with it the argument order:
   ``CapFloor.collar`` takes cap rates first, and swapping the lists builds a
   long-3%-cap short-7%-floor instrument nowhere near the pinned value.
H. That the payment adjustment reaches the coupons, which E cannot show - see
   that test's own docstring.
I. That the fixing days and the payment day counter reach the coupons, which E
   also cannot show - see that test's own docstring.

Three things E is blind to, each of which has its own arm above:

- The spot caplet. Dropping the first coupon leaves both cached values bit
  identical, because that optionlet is worth exactly zero here: its fixing date
  IS the evaluation date, so it has no time value, and the ~5% forward sits
  outside both the 7% cap and the 3% floor, so it has no intrinsic value
  either. What catches a dropped spot coupon is the count arm, not the literal.
- The fixing days and the payment day counter. The fixture passes each setter
  the index's own default - Euribor 6M already fixes at two days and accrues
  Actual/360 - so deleting either setter's wiring entirely leaves all three
  cached values unchanged. Only moving each OFF the index default discriminates
  it, which is what arm I does.
- The payment adjustment, inert here for a different reason: see arm H.

Every arm builds its own ``CapFloor``. An ``Instrument`` caches its NPV, so
reusing one cap across two engines would let arm B pass on a stale number, and
the raw-leg arms build a fresh engine per instrument as the core does.

Two ``Settings`` objects live here, deliberately. The MakeCapFloor arms resolve
against ``SETTINGS`` at 2026 and the raw-leg arms against ``ORACLE_SETTINGS`` at
14-Mar-2002; moving the shared one would let test ordering decide the other
pass's fate. Within each pass a single object drives the curve-backed index,
every instrument and every engine, or the leg and the optionlets date
differently with no error raised.
