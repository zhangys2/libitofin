"""InterpolatedZeroInflationCurve<Linear> (#749).

Directly-built curve, no bootstrap. Mirrors the Rust oracle in
crates/libitofin/src/termstructures/inflation/interpolatedzeroinflationcurve.rs
(`nodes_round_trip_the_input_dates`,
`the_base_node_sits_before_the_reference_date_at_a_negative_time` and
`zero_rate_date_quantizes_to_the_period_start_and_interpolates`), on a fixture
of its own so every time below is exact arithmetic.

The reference date is 13 Aug 2007 and the base date, the first node, is 1 Jul
2007 - before it. Under Thirty360 BondBasis the base node time is
30 * (7 - 8) + (1 - 13) = -42, over 360, and the second node 1 Sep 2007 sits at
30 * (9 - 8) + (1 - 13) = 18, over 360. Every node falls on the first of a
month, which under Frequency.Monthly is already the start of its own inflation
period, so a node read reaches that node's time exactly and returns its rate
with no interpolation.
