"""The Inflation-in-Python milestone (#752): fourteen quoted zero-coupon
inflation swaps bootstrap a curve and are then repriced to nothing off it.

This mirrors the Rust oracle's phase 1, `piecewisezeroinflationcurve.rs:779`
(itself `test-suite/inflation.cpp` `testZeroTermStructure` `:400-434`). The
swaps repriced here are rebuilt standalone on the *real* 5 % nominal curve, not
the helpers' own zero-strike swaps on their flat 0 % one, so the check is an
absolute one rather than a self-consistent round trip: it discriminates the
bootstrap's convergence, the base-date node placement, the fixing-period
quantization and the forecast formula at once, at the C++ tolerance of 1e-7.

Fixture. It is 13 August 2007. UK RPI carries the thirty-one monthly figures
published from January 2005, so the curve's base date is the July 2007 period
and every forecast compounds off its 207.3. Fourteen swap rates are quoted out
to 2057 under a three-month observation lag, flat CPI observation, UK
settlement calendar and Thirty360 BondBasis throughout.

Phase 3 (#813), the seasonality rerun, follows below: the same fourteen swaps
still reprice to nothing once a twelve-factor monthly correction is installed on
the bootstrapped curve, and the forecast the swaps reach it through demonstrably
moves.

Omitted visibly: phase 2 (`:913`), where the index forecasting off the
bootstrapped curve is checked against the curve's own compounded zero rate, is
left on the Rust side. It exercises no facade this file does not already build,
and the ticket scopes it out.

What the guards do and do not cover. Thirty-one hand-typed floats are the
largest silent-failure surface here, and a green milestone does not vindicate
them: only two are load-bearing for phase 1 - May 2007, which the swaps' base
observation reads from history, and July 2007, which the forecast compounds off
- and both are read back explicitly below. The remaining twenty-nine are
covered by count alone.
