`log_linear_discount_consistency`, `linear_discount_consistency`, and
`bootstrap_is_lazy_and_reruns_on_quote_change`). The round-trip is
self-consistent: every instrument reprices its own input quote off the
bootstrapped curve, so there are no discount-factor literals; the pytest pins
the input quotes (DEPOSIT_DATA/SWAP_DATA, transcribed from
piecewiseyieldcurve.cpp). Tolerance 1e-9 (:322), checked with a bare
`abs(got - expected)` because `pytest.approx`'s default `rel=1e-6` would relax
