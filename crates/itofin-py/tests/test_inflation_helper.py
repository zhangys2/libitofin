"""ZeroCouponInflationSwapHelper and PiecewiseZeroInflationCurve, structurally
(#751).

The numeric milestone - fourteen quoted swaps repriced to zero off the
bootstrapped curve - is #752. What is checked here is the wiring the milestone
would fail on for reasons it could not report: the helper's dates under both
observation interpolations, the trailing pillar keyword that picks its node, and
that the bootstrapped curve lays node zero on the base date and reaches Python
through *both* halves of its class chain.

Fixture. It is 13 August 2007. UK RPI carries the four monthly figures the Rust
core fixture carries (piecewisezeroinflationcurve.rs:345-356), so the curve's
base date is July 2007 and every forecast compounds off its 207.3. One swap is
quoted, at 3 % to 13 August 2008 under a three-month observation lag. The
caller's index is deliberately never linked to a curve: the helper prices
through a copy of it on a handle of its own, so a bootstrap that needed the
caller's link would fail here rather than silently read the wrong curve.

The two dates the helper reports are not the same date and the fixture is
chosen so they cannot be confused. 13 August 2008 less three months is 13 May
2008, which is what the contract observes; the helper rounds that to 1 May 2008,
the first day of its monthly inflation period, and puts its curve node there.
