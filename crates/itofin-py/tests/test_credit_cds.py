"""CreditDefaultSwap priced by MidPointCdsEngine (#739).

The cached-value oracle mirrors the Rust one in
crates/libitofin/src/pricingengines/credit/midpointcdsengine.rs
(`a_ten_year_contract_matches_the_cached_mid_point_value`, itself
`testCachedValue` in creditdefaultswap.cpp:57-117): a ten-year contract on a
flat 1.234% hazard rate and a flat 6% continuous discount curve, seen from the
protection seller, is worth 295.0153398 and quotes a fair spread of
0.007517539081.

The two schedule dates are the C++ `calendar.advance(today, -1Y, Following)` and
`advance(issue, +10Y, Following)` hardcoded from a Rust probe of that fixture,
which printed `issue=2005-06-09 maturity=2015-06-09`. The Rust fixture builds its
schedule with `Schedule::new(.., DateGeneration::Forward, ..)` while `Schedule`
here goes through `MakeSchedule(..).forwards()`; a probe confirmed both produce
the same 21 dates and price identically, so the Python path is the same
contract, not a lookalike.
