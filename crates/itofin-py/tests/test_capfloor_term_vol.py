"""Oracle for the cap/floor term-volatility surface facade (issue #622).

The fixture is the core module test's (``capfloortermvolsurface.rs`` tests):
TARGET, ModifiedFollowing, Actual/365F, reference 15-June-2026, option tenors
[1Y,2Y,3Y,4Y] x strikes [1%..5%] and the 4x5 grid ``0.10 + 0.01*i + 0.001*j``.
The grid is deliberately NON-FLAT and NON-SQUARE: a transposed grid fails the
core's dimension check outright, and a swapped axis fails numerically, so the
node-recovery arm cannot pass on a facade that crosses the axes.

The two pinned constructors need no ``Settings``: they fix the reference date,
so no query reads an evaluation date. The two moving ones do, and the fixture's
``SETTINGS`` sits on ``REFERENCE`` so all four agree on the reference date.

Four arms:

A. Node recovery at 1e-12, on BOTH constructors. Bicubic is exact at the nodes,
   so all 20 come back. Running it on the quote form as well as the matrix form
   is what pins the ORIENTATION of the handle grid - arm B only reads two cells
   of one row, which a transposing ``with_quotes`` would survive.
B. Quote-bump refresh on the quote constructor. Reading a node, bumping its
   quote and re-reading pins the observer chain end to end through Python: a
   spline built once and never rebuilt serves the stale vol. The untouched
   neighbour must not move, which catches a rebuild that floods one value
   across the grid.
C. The three query forms agree at an off-node point (18M x 2.5%, on no tenor
   and no strike node). ``volatility`` resolves the tenor against the surface's
   own calendar and convention, ``volatility_date`` takes that date, and
   ``volatility_time`` takes the year fraction; they are one call chain in the
   core, so this is an EXACT equality, not a tolerance. Both the date and the
   time are computed independently on the Python side - the date by advancing
   the reference on TARGET/ModifiedFollowing, which is what the core's
   tenor-to-date conversion does, and the time as Act/365F's integer days over
   365 - so the arm is an independent check of the resolution chain rather than
   a tautology. The value must also land between the four surrounding nodes,
   which pins that the query interpolates rather than snapping to one.
D. The shape guard. A ragged grid is rejected as an ``ItofinError`` before it
   reaches the core, where a short row would index a `Matrix` out of bounds and
   panic across the FFI boundary.
E. The two MOVING constructors (#623), whose reference date floats
   ``settlement_days`` off the evaluation date rather than being pinned. They
   are a distinct code path, not a thin wrapper: they carry the settlement days
   the optionlet-stripping adapter reads back, and the quote form registers
   market data the matrix form does not. Both go through arm A, so a
   transposed grid cannot hide behind the flat fixture the stripping oracle
   uses; the quote form also goes through arm B's bump. At zero settlement days
   their reference date IS the evaluation date, which the fixture sets to
   REFERENCE, so they must recover exactly the pinned surface's nodes.
