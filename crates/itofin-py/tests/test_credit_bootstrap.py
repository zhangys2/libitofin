"""Bootstrap round-trip oracle for the piecewise credit curve (#742).

Mirrors the core fixture at ``piecewisedefaultcurve.rs:436-525``, itself
``defaultprobabilitycurves.cpp`` ``testBootstrapFromSpread<HazardRate,
BackwardFlat>`` (``:152-224``): four CDS quotes are bootstrapped into a hazard
curve, then each pillar's contract is rebuilt from the market conventions and
repriced off that curve, and must return its own input spread.

The round trip is non-tautological because the contract is built fresh rather
than asked back from the helper: a facade that dropped the quote, the rule or
the protection start would still produce a curve, but not one the rebuilt
contract reprices on. ``fair_spread`` is compared, not ``implied_quote``.

Three things the milestone depends on and that a looser fixture would hide:

* ``include_todays_cash_flows`` is set before the first read, not merely before
  the constructor - the curve is lazy, so the first read is what runs the
  bootstrap the flag governs.
* the round-trip schedule starts at the rolled protection start
  (``piecewisedefaultcurve.rs:403-405``), as the helper's own does
  (``defaultprobabilityhelpers.rs:496-498``). Starting it at the evaluation date
  instead adds three days of premium accrual against an unchanged protection
  leg.
* ``protection_start`` is passed explicitly. Left out, it defaults to the
  schedule's first date, which the twentieth-IMM rule puts ten days later.
