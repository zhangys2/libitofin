"""The year-on-year coupon and leg facades (#848): a leg built directly from
Python lays its coupons out on a schedule and rates each one off the linked
curve.

Fixture. The bootstrapped year-on-year curve of test_yoy_inflation_reprice.py,
which that file pins end to end: it is 13 August 2007, UK RPI carries the
thirty-one monthly figures published from January 2005, and fifteen quoted swaps
fit a Monthly curve the *ratio* year-on-year index is then linked onto. Only the
curve is reused here; nothing about the leg is.

The oracle. `rate()` is NOT checked against `gearing * coupon.index_fixing() +
spread`: that is the swaplet pricer's own expression, so both sides would break
together. It is checked against the index read at a date this file derives
itself, `index.fixing(<the first of the month the accrual end minus the lag
falls in>)`, with the observation dates written out as literals. That pins three
things the pricer could get wrong independently - that the observation lags off
the accrual *end* rather than off `fixing_date()`, that the lag is subtracted
before the period snap, and that the snap is Monthly - while sharing only the
forecast machinery, which the reprice fixture already pins.

The accrual-end anchor needs its own coupon to show at all. With no fixing days
the fixing date and the lagged accrual end are the same day, so the two rules
agree by accident; the leg in
test_the_rate_lags_off_the_accrual_end_not_off_the_fixing_date pushes them into
different months.

Omitted visibly: caps and floors, which the facade does not expose (a capped
coupon needs a pricer carrying an optionlet volatility, and #838's cap/floor
instrument is the supported route), and the erased `build()` leg.
