"""ZeroCouponInflationSwap priced without a bootstrap (#750).

The swap is built over a DIRECTLY-built InterpolatedZeroInflationCurve (#749)
linked into a UK RPI index (#748) through the new ZeroInflationIndex.link_to,
and discounted by a flat nominal curve. A directly-built curve does not reprice
its own swaps to zero, so every number below is a pin taken from a throwaway
Rust probe over the identical fixture, not a milestone the swap has to hit.

What the pins are for: the 14-argument constructor order, the forecast reaching
the index through the curve link, and the engine reaching the swap. The core
numerics are not under test here - crates/libitofin/src/instruments/
zerocouponinflationswap.rs pins those against hand-derived amounts, including
the raw-vs-adjusted year fraction that this fixture cannot see.

Fixture. It is 13 August 2007. Two RPI figures are on record: May 2007, which
the swap's own base observation (13 Aug 2007 less the three-month lag) reads
from history, and July 2007, the curve's base date, which the forecast
machinery compounds off (inflationindex.rs:479-498). Both sit at or before the
publication horizon - 13 Aug less RPI's one-month availability lag puts it in
July 2007 - so neither is itself forecast. The maturity observation, 13 May
2008, is well past it and so is forecast off the curve; 1 May 2008 falls
strictly between the 1 Jan and 1 Jul 2008 nodes, so it reads an interpolated
rate rather than a node outright.
