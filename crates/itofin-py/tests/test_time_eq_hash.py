"""Value equality and hashing for Period, DayCounter (#864) and Date (#879).

Both facades wrap a core type that defines equality, but neither exposed it, so
Python compared them by identity and neither could key a dict or join a set.

The oracle is the core semantics, not a field comparison. Period equality is
decidable-ordering equality (period.rs:315-320): `partial_cmp` returns None for
a pair no calendar can resolve, which equality reads as not equal. So 7 Days
equals 1 Week and 12 Months equals 1 Year, while 30 Days against 1 Month is not
equal. DayCounter equality is by convention name (daycounter.rs:131-141).

The discriminating cases are the cross-unit ones. A naive hash of the raw
(length, unit) pair satisfies every equality assertion here and still breaks the
hash contract: it would separate 7 Days from 1 Week in a set although they
compare equal. Each cross-unit equality below is therefore paired with a hash
assertion, and the set and dict cases turn that contract into observable
behaviour.

Omitted visibly: the arm reading a DayCounter back off an object that built one
(the from_inner path). The only such getter is the year-on-year coupon's
`day_counter()`, which needs a bootstrapped inflation curve to reach; equality
delegates to the same core PartialEq either way, so the fixture is not worth its
cost here.
