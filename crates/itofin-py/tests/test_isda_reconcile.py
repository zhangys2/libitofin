"""The two EUR Markit reconciliation records, through the Python facades (#870).

The oracle is QuantLib's `testIsdaEngine` reconciliation half
(test-suite/creditdefaultswap.cpp:759-960), which the Rust core reproduces in
`a_traded_today_record_reconciles_with_its_accrual_rebate` and
`a_record_traded_in_the_past_reconciles_without_its_accrual_rebate`
(crates/libitofin/src/pricingengines/credit/isdacdsengine.rs:2085 and :2147).
Both fixtures are rebuilt here: the same 26 July 2021 value date, the same four
deposit and thirteen swap EUR quotes bootstrapped log-linearly on discount
factors over Act/365F, and the same flat hazard rate implied off a trade quoted
at the conventional 0.006713 spread.

One record is traded today and rebates the thousand of accrual it has run up;
the same record traded two years earlier settled that rebate long before today,
so the value drops by exactly that thousand and the two legs then account for
all of what is left. The MARKIT_VALUE literals are Markit's, so they grade the
whole chain rather than restating it.

The helpers below are the USD ones of test_isda_markit.py parameterized on what
the EUR curve changes - the quotes, the 6M float tenor, the Annual fixed
frequency and the currency. They are duplicated rather than imported because no
test module in this suite imports another and there is no conftest to share
them through.

The tolerance is Boost's `BOOST_CHECK_CLOSE`, a *percentage*, so the bound is a
relative 1e-5 and it is two-sided against both operands.
