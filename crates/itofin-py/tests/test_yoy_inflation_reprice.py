"""The year-on-year inflation milestone (#849): fifteen quoted year-on-year
inflation swaps bootstrap a curve, and the fourteen past the base pillar are
then repriced to nothing off it.

This mirrors the Rust oracle `piecewiseyoyinflationcurve.rs:807-858` (itself
`test-suite/inflation.cpp` `testYYTermStructure` `:1198-1224`). The swaps
repriced here are rebuilt standalone on the real 5 % nominal curve rather than
read off the helpers, so nothing the bootstrap cached can carry the result: only
the curve does. It discriminates the bootstrap's convergence, the base-date node
placement, the fixing-period quantization and the year-on-year forecast at once.

Fixture. It is 13 August 2007. UK RPI carries the thirty-one monthly figures
published from January 2005, so the curve's base date is the July 2007 period.
The year-on-year index is the *ratio* form over that RPI, which owns no history
of its own and divides two RPI figures a year apart. Fifteen swap rates are
quoted out to 2037 under a two-month observation lag, flat CPI observation, UK
settlement calendar and Thirty360 BondBasis throughout.

Two frequencies live in this fixture and must not be conflated. The *curve* is
Monthly, because UK RPI publishes monthly and the curve's frequency is what
quantizes its nodes and its base date. The *swap schedules* are Annual, because
year-on-year coupons pay yearly. Passing either one where the other belongs
moves every number.

Omitted visibly: seasonality on a year-on-year curve, which the zero side covers
(test_zc_inflation_reprice.py) through the same base-class setter this curve
inherits.
