"""The floating ibor leg facade (#626): a leg built directly from Python lays
its coupons out on a schedule.

This file is STRUCTURAL. The leg's coupons are not exposed - they exist to be
consumed by the raw ``CapFloor.cap`` / ``floor`` / ``collar`` constructors - so
what is checkable here is the coupon count, the required notional and the
setter semantics. The numeric oracle for the leg is in test_capfloor.py, where
the same builder reproduces the core's cached cap and floor NPVs to 1e-11; a
leg that laid its coupons out wrongly could not hit those literals.

What is pinned here:

A. A 5Y semiannual schedule yields one coupon per schedule period.
B. A leg with no notional raises rather than building a coupon-less leg: the
   core reports "no notional given" and the facade surfaces it at
   ``coupon_count`` rather than at construction, since the core builder is
   consumed only when the coupons are read.
C. The setters return a NEW leg and leave the receiver alone. This is the shape
   the core's consumed-self chain has and the reason a leg can be bound to a
   name and reused; a mutate-in-place facade would let an earlier binding
   silently change under a later call.
