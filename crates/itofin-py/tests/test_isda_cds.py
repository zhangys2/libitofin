"""CreditDefaultSwap priced by IsdaCdsEngine (#812).

The three pinned values come from the Rust test
`the_flat_curve_fixture_prices_to_the_pinned_value` in the `binding_oracle`
module of crates/libitofin/src/pricingengines/credit/isdacdsengine.rs, which
records them from its own run. That fixture is rebuilt here byte-for-byte - the
same evaluation date, the same two flat Act/365F curves referenced at it, the
same TARGET/Following/Forward quarterly schedule and the same contract terms -
so the literals grade the facade rather than restate whatever it happens to
return.

The schedule shape is asserted on both sides (13 dates, first the evaluation
date, last the maturity) so a drift in the dates is told apart from a drift in
the pricing, and the two legs are pinned alongside the value so a mismatch says
which half moved.

Two flat curves leave the ISDA integration grid as the maturity alone
(isdanodegrid.rs:122-124), which is still a genuine single-node ISDA reprice and
still distinct from the mid-point engine's period-by-period integration - hence
the discriminator below.
