"""The capped/floored year-on-year leg path (#863): a leg given caps or floors
hands back coupons whose optionlets an optionlet pricer values.

Fixture. The Rust coupon oracle `capflooredyoyinflationcoupon_oracle.rs`,
transcribed. It is 10 February 2022 and UK YY_RPI has published exactly two
year-on-year figures, May 2021 at 2.81% and November 2021 at 2.935%. The
volatility surface observes inflation eight months back, so its base date is
1 June 2021; the coupons observe three months back. That gap is the whole point
of the fixture: a coupon whose fixing lands on or before the surface's base date
is *determined* and priced as pure intrinsic value with no volatility read at
all, while one fixing after it is priced under a distribution even though its
fixing is already history. No forecast curve appears - every figure read is
published - so the numbers isolate the coupon arithmetic.

Reaching the fixture. The Rust oracle builds its coupon directly; Python has no
standalone coupon constructor, so this file reaches the same coupon through
YoYInflationLeg.capped_floored_coupons(). That only reproduces the oracle if the
leg's single coupon accrues exactly the year ending on the anchored date: with
only two published figures, one day of schedule drift lands the observation in an
unpublished month and index_fixing() raises. Hence the single-period schedule
written out date by date, Unadjusted so nothing rolls, and the generation rule
passed explicitly - the Python Schedule facade defaults Forward where the core
MakeSchedule defaults Backward.

One Settings object stands behind both the index and the surface. Two would
resolve their dates against different evaluation dates and the rate would be
silently wrong.

The oracle. The determined arm is pinned by arithmetic this file derives, and
its rate() collapses onto the cap level, which is blind to a cap-the-whole-total
mis-wire - so effective_cap()/effective_floor(), the only direct pin on the
de-gearing and de-spreading, are asserted alongside. The live arm's three
distribution literals were probed off the Rust fixture built the direct way, so
reproducing them here checks the leg path rather than restating it. The
sum-identity and collar-identity the Rust oracle also carries are deliberately
NOT ported: both are blind to a consistently mis-wired strike.
