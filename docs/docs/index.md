# itofin

[`libitofin`](https://crates.io/crates/libitofin) is a ground-up port of
[QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/) into idiomatic Rust, with Python and Go
bindings. All three language surfaces share the Rust numerical core.

- **Fidelity in numerics, usability at the boundary.** QuantLib is the oracle for every
  number; the Python API adds ergonomic conveniences (keyword constructors, `price(engine)`)
  without changing the math.
- **Typed and introspectable.** Every class ships hand-written `.pyi` stubs with Google-style
  docstrings, so editors autocomplete and this site renders the full signature.

## Install

=== "Python"

    ```bash
    pip install itofin
    ```

=== "Rust"

    ```bash
    cargo add libitofin
    ```

=== "Go"

    Install the matching native library first, following the [Go SDK guide](go.md).
    Then add the module to your application:

    ```sh
    go get github.com/benbenbang/libitofin/sdk/go@v0.39.0
    ```

    Go requires cgo, a C compiler, and the `itofin_external` build tag for
    applications outside this repository.

The [Getting started](getting-started.md) page has runnable pricing examples
in Python, Rust, and Go. The [project index](https://github.com/benbenbang/libitofin#readme)
links to the language guides and project documentation.

## Reviewed Rust additions

- [Priority adoption scope and limits](priority-adoption.md): 18 retained High
  rows, with 10 excluded because existing issue acceptance already owns them.
- Rust-core only: no new Python, C or Go facades, and no release implied.
