"""Price a year-on-year inflation cap and floor under three distributions.

A `YoYInflationCapFloor` is a strip of optionlets on the year-on-year rate a
`YoYInflationIndex` publishes, one per coupon of an annual inflation leg. It is
built through `MakeYoYInflationCapFloor`, the standard market builder: the core
builder is a consumed-self fluent chain that does not cross the FFI boundary, so
the Python facade takes the whole configuration up front and assembles the chain
inside `build()`.

Three things this shows that no other example does.

* The distribution is chosen by the *constructor*, mirroring C++'s three engine
  classes rather than being passed as an argument: `YoYInflationCapFloorEngine`
  has `black` (lognormal), `unit_displaced` (lognormal in 1 + rate) and
  `bachelier` (normal). On this fixture the last two sit two orders of magnitude
  above Black, so a constructor wired to the wrong distribution cannot hide.
* An engine carries the arguments and results of whatever it last priced, so a
  cap and a floor priced together want one engine each.
* `strike` and `atm_strike` are mutually exclusive and exactly one is required.
  The refusal lands in `build()`, not at the setters, because a fluent setter
  returning `Self` has nowhere to raise from.

The numbers reproduce QuantLib's `inflationcapfloorengines.cpp:452-522`
(`testCachedValue`), as transcribed in
`crates/itofin-py/tests/test_yoy_inflation_capfloor.py`. QuantLib's own
tolerance is 0.02 on a notional of a million, which these only reach if the
curve, the base date, the zero observation lag and the distribution are all
right at once.

Fixture warning. `yoy_inflation_swap.py` next door runs a *different* UK RPI
fixture, and the two must not be crossed. This one files thirty-one published
figures followed by TWO -999.0 sentinels on a BACKWARD-generated schedule, which
carries the index's last fixing date - and with it the curve's base date - out
to 1 August 2007. The leg, the volatility surface and the builder observe ZERO
days of lag while only the fifteen bootstrap helpers observe two months (in C++
this comes of a `CommonVars` member being shadowed by a local in the constructor
body); pricing the leg at two months instead misses every cached value by about
47. The nominal curve is Act/Act (ISDA), not Act/360.
