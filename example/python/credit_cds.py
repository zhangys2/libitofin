"""Price a credit default swap and bootstrap a default-probability curve.

Two parts:

1. Price a single CDS with `MidPointCdsEngine` off a flat hazard-rate curve.
   The engine needs a survival (hazard) curve, a recovery rate and a discount
   curve. This reproduces QuantLib's `creditdefaultswap.cpp` cached value:
   NPV 295.0153398 and fair spread 0.007517539081. Both are matched to 1e-7,
   the tolerance `test_credit_cds.py` grades them at: the fair spread's
   difference sits in the eighth decimal place, not in all twelve printed.

2. Bootstrap a `PiecewiseDefaultCurve` from `SpreadCdsHelper` quotes (the
   inverse problem: given market spreads, solve for the hazard curve), then
   rebuild each pillar's contract on that curve and confirm it reprices to its
   own input spread. Mirrors `defaultprobabilitycurves.cpp`.

The bootstrap round-trip is exact only when the rebuilt contract matches the
helper's own conventions to the day, so the schedule construction below is
copied verbatim from `test_credit_bootstrap.py` (rolled protection start,
unadjusted maturity, explicit `protection_start`). A "simplified" schedule still
runs but quietly misses the quotes.

Run it with:
