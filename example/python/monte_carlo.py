"""Price options by Monte Carlo: European, Heston, and American.

Three different MC engines, attached through three different setters:

* `MCEuropeanEngine`      -> `option.set_mc_engine(...)`
* `MCEuropeanHestonEngine`-> `option.set_mc_heston_engine(...)`
* `MCAmericanEngine`      -> `option.set_mc_american_engine(...)` on an option
  built with `VanillaOption.american(...)`.

Unlike the analytic engine, an MC engine reports a standard error via
`option.error_estimate()`, and the American engine additionally reports the
fraction of paths exercised early via `option.exercise_probability()`. Both of
those raise on the analytic engine, so only call them on the MC options.

Pricing is seeded, so a given seed reproduces bitwise. The European result is
cross-checked against the analytic engine; the Heston and American results are
banded against QuantLib's cached values.

Run it with:
